But when you discuss your quirky interests, I just think you're all the more awesome! Like your fixation on Nintendo games. It reminds me of my older brother though... Mostly I relate to your shyness because I am usually quiet and stray from new people. And I too have came out of my shell more by having acted and danced on stage.

"          Phamnuwen,As much as I'd like to be polite, you spend most of your time degrading America and excusing murderous, oppressive Chinese behavior and their bad environmental policies. You wrote that ""the epithet ""Communist China"" seems to be mainly used by Americans looking to recall their own long-gone glory days of freedom and capitalism."" Do I have to remind you that the government of China is still officially communist, and that the constitution of China requires that the leaders be members of the Communist Party? Yes, they are currently behaving more like capitalists, but that could easily change.In 1921, Lenin, the leader of the Soviet Union, decided that the time was not right for full communism. He introduced the New Economic Policy (NEP), which allowed a significant amount of capitalism mixed with some state owned businesses. Look it up at Wikipedia or somewhere else. Lenin's NEP is very similar to the system that China currently has. When Stalin took over after Lenin's death in 1928, Stalin ended the NEP. If that history is a guide, China is one crisis or one dictator away from a return to full communism. Even though the Chinese people don't want this, if the military backs the government, they won't have a choice. That's what happens when you don't have free elections. You also wrote ""on the Chinese regime's crimes, it is also worth noting that they were mainly perpetrated internally, inside China. While this clearly doesn't excuse them, I prefer this over a regime that tries to control the entire world."" This is completely absurd!!!! The system that you regard as evil and controlling is the same one that allows China to trade with the U.S., which has benefited China immensely. Without the U.S. maintaining a peaceful world, China would suffer too as it would not be able to obtain the raw materials it needs at reasonable prices from faraway countries. Let me say this clearly, the current economic and military policies of the U.S. has been of tremendous benefit to China.As to China's current environmental policies, they are deliberately destructive because that's the fastest way to get some GDP. China could easily learn from the mistakes of the West, but that might cost a few jobs in the short run. I personally think it would just shift some jobs from making consumer and industrial goods into making pollution control equipment, which is my understanding of what finally happened in the West. You also wrote ""but let's focus on what is happening today, lest we end up debating slavery, or what have you..."" I wrote in my first post that ""the Communist leadership in China - which does not allow free elections - has and will continue to commit far greater crimes than anything being committed by '""the empire in decline.""  Note the words I first wrote: has and will continue. This is not just in the far past. The oppression of the Chinese people continue to this very day. As an example, one of the other posters in this thread mentioned land seizures which occur whenever the government decides on a new project.The only point I agree with you on is that the U.S. government is behaving in a socialist way. We'll see if this continues after the next election. There's a chance we can change it peacefully, by democratic means. It's unfortunate that the Chinese people don't have the same opportunity.Finally, I'm sorry but I don't find you either pro-democratic or pro-American in any way that really matters.            "
"          Not saying you don't have a point, just letting you know a point of view that doesn't see political matters as being a screen through which industry or invention has to be viewed.

Please read more carefully in the future.""Yes, they are currently behaving more like capitalists, but that could easily change.""Of course it could change. But that goes for everything. Including democracy.We should judge people on how they actually act. Not on how we think they may act in the future.""Even though the Chinese people don't want this, if the military backs the government, they won't have a choice. That's what happens when you don't have free elections.""I think the citizens of China (including the armed forces and most of the ""Communist Party"") are too enlightened at this point to revert to actual communism, in practice. Of course, we should never say never.Free elections and democracy is not what restrains the state. For that, you need citizens with guns.""This is completely absurd!!!! The system that you regard as evil and controlling is the same one that allows China to trade with the U.S., which has benefited China immensely.""Considering that trade needs no ""system"" whatsoever, only two people willing to exchange resources, what ""system"" are you referring to?""Without the U.S. maintaining a peaceful world, China would suffer too as it would not be able to obtain the raw materials it needs at reasonable prices from faraway countries.""Ok... We're sort of drifting off into fantasy land here, but for what it's worth: While the United States indeed has fought a number of legitimate wars (i.e. wars of a defensive nature, where the goal is to end an initiated attack against yourself), the prime example obviously being WW2, where Japan attacked the U.S. first.Most of them however, are not legitimate. They are not defensive in nature, which means they are aggressive in nature. If you act aggressively, you are not a peacekeeper.The idea that China needs the United States to start wars left right and center to be able to trade is just too bizarre. Any country can trade with any other country they like. They don't need the approval or protection of third parties.""China could easily learn from the mistakes of the West, but that might cost a few jobs in the short run.""You underestimate the harm that is done by poverty, and overestimate the harm done by pollution. Most people would rather be alive and polluted than starve to death in a pristine eco-paradise. Taking care of the environment actually can wait until the kids have been fed and somewhat educated. It is a rational tradeoff.""I wrote in my first post that ""the Communist leadership in China - which does not allow free elections - has and will continue to commit far greater crimes than anything being committed by '""the empire in decline."" Note the words I first wrote: has and will continue.""I don't argue that China has murdered more people than the United States. Like I said before though, China has kept their evil deeds mainly within their own borders. The same cannot be said for the United States. This matters tremendously for everyone who does not live in The the U.S. or China. Let me again emphasize that not all U.S. foreign wars and policies have been evil. Some have been legitimate and no blame should fall upon the people who fought in those.You should not be so sure of what will happen in the future. The future is unknown. Claiming to know the future does not inspire confidence.""The oppression of the Chinese people continue to this very day. As an example, one of the other posters in this thread mentioned land seizures which occur whenever the government decides on a new project.""Eminent domain, (which is indeed an evil policy) happens in a lot of countries, including the U.S. , as far as I know. Democracy doesn't help you there.""Finally, I'm sorry but I don't find you either pro-democratic or pro-American in any way that really matters.""I never said I was pro-democratic. I am pro-liberty. Democracy (majority rule) is actually systematic oppression of minorities.Democracy and freedom is NOT the same thing.Being pro-American in the spirit of the Declaration of Independence does not really matter? Well, that just says it all, doesn't it?Just out of curiosity: Can you define what pro-American means, according to you, if the ideals of the founders isn't it?            "
"          The video about ETT seems like a good idea but seems limited for uses of freight where the real cost advantage of a train is to be found. I think the Chinese or whoever decides build vac tube transport should understand that they would be building two very different kinds of systems considering the issues of commuting versus cargo.I went to the ETT site but they failed to mention cost per kg per mile per watt and instead did  calculation in a piecemeal fashion. I'm a big fan of maglev because of the benefits you would get wheel-less systems that would be created in other industries. However, nobody's compared ETT with a large scale VacLev  Trains where maglev trains are put into evacuated  tunnels.            "
"          This article touts something that cannot happen in a country run by a Communist government.  ""In ""Economic Calculation in a Socialist Commonwealth,"" Ludwig von Mises demonstrates, once and forever, that, under socialist central planning, there are no means of economic calculation and that, therefore, socialist economy itself is ""impossible"" --not just inefficient or less innovative or conducted without benefit of decentralized knowledge, but really and truly and literally impossible.""see: Postscript: Why a Socialist Economy is ""Impossible"" by Joseph T. Salerno, link: http://mises.org/econcalc/POST...China has a problem that will result in crippling social and political issues at any instant: it has a government that will pay any price to remain in power.   This has been manifested in the past by the dozens of millions that died in the Great Leap Forward and the estimated 20 million who have perished in the labor camps.   We see it today in the civil unrest caused when corrupt officials seize land for development projects.   It is even manifested in the extremely large holdings of foreign exchange, an asset the government will not spend for internal development projects.  Such a society is very brittle.  We now know that Chinese economic statistics are false.  Local communist officials are pressed to continue economic development.  They presently achieve their targets by approving and funding construction projects that go vacant.  Indeed, fully 50% of China's economic growth is in construction.   There are YouTube videos of vacant shopping malls and vacant cities.  As with the Soviet Union, every layer of the bureaucracy lies about progress to the layer above it.  This is all financed by fiat money credit expansion.  When the fiat money credit expansion scheme fails, it will crash exactly like the Fannie-Freddie credit expansion in the US did.  Only this time the crash will be many time greater and hit many more people who lack the financial resources to survive.   The economic consequences will be grave.The idea that China will be successful because it will grow into one big, efficient, factory city is absurd.  This is further supported by the news from Bloomberg that rising wages in China have cut its cost  advantage.  ===Rising China Wages Cut Advantage Over Mexico, Flextronics SaysBy Tim Culpan and Frederik Balfour - Aug 29, 2010 11:01 AM CTChina’s rising wages are cutting the country’s cost advantage over othermanufacturing centers such as Mexico, according to Flextronics InternationalLtd., the world’s second-largest custom electronics maker.“As China moves up, up and up and up, for five straight years, it’s beenmoving up heading towards Mexican pricing,” Mike McNamara, Chief ExecutiveOfficer of Singapore-based Flextronics, said in an interview. “Mexico’s beenthe same labor cost for the past five years, it hasn’t moved up at all.”Flextronics, which supplies to Hewlett-Packard Co. and Cisco Systems Inc.,has been forced to increase wages in China in line with governmentregulations and growing affluence in the fastest-growing major economy.Larger rival Foxconn Technology Group said this month it will moveproduction away from China’s coastal regions after announcing a doubling ofwages at its largest production bases in the south east....http://www.bloomberg.com/news/...

"          I live in a neighborhood with 2 story houses  and our neighbor put in a solar system to reduce his electrical costs.  This actually makes sense: due to the perverse ""tier"" pricing of PG&E, most normal users use well over their 100% allotment, and by %300, the marginal price is $0.41/kw-Hr.  Getting enough solar to get you back down below the 200% tier (where the marginal cost jumps from $0.17/kw-Hr to $0.27/kw-Hr) is actually a reasonable investment.At any rate, he's only had it for six months and yesterday I saw a van in his driveway that looked a lot like the carpet cleaner vans than one sees from time to time. These guys, however,  were there to clean the solar panels.  Up on the roof, 30 feet above the ground, was a young man cleaning the panels with what looked like a squeegee with a hose attached to it.  Not ropes, no harnesses, just walking around on the roof swabbing the panels.If this is the norm, rooftop solar is going to have a very high death rate when measured as deaths/GWey.            "
"          So... authors /or/ blogmasters

Oft this site reports such interesting and sanguine statistics as ""number of deaths per GWey"" for various power technologies.  Other statistics that collectively could be described as infrequently cited risks associated with progress  (pretty good!) are also sometimes presented. 

However, the sentiment of the popular narrative regarding China is wow, aren't they amazing, fantastic, progressive, hot, Hot, HOT! no? Even the prima faciae of this very article promotes the narrative. 

YET... exactly in light of ""deaths per something-or-another"" for a technology, how about ACCIDENT deaths from China's super-rail system per year?  The Australian estimates 8,000 deaths a year!  http://www.theaustralian.com.a... ... which - to this old goat - seems like quite a few, quite a few.

Perhaps NBF will consider following up with some (good, reasonably unmixed) statistics regarding the relative safety of various public transportation systems, be they heavy commercial air, rail, bus, light air, cars, and who knows ... ferries and steamships.  

MY goal... is to ensure that the popular narrative about China's great prowess as the next world superpower doesn't consistently omit China's ""devil may care"" pollutive, humanist, risk taking policies.  

=GoatGuy=            "
"          Ummm I think that your reaching out a bit here. The article you link to talks about the 8,000 deaths and then directly compares it to the 75,000 deaths from cars. The next big future has always been about dispelling popular fears with its deaths per watt stats, and promoting nuclear power. And dude when has humanist been an insult? Unless your religious extremist, or a member of the volunteer human extinction movement. And if you want to watch china screw up its environmental policies, western mainstream media does that well enough.            "
"          Please... There are far greater evils being perpetrated all the time, as intentional policies, by the empire in decline, than a bit of pollution by China.But let's not go there...            "
"          So, China's pollution problems should be excused because of unnamed ""greater evils"" being committed by ""the empire in decline,"" which I assume you mean is the U.S. The Communist leadership in China - which does not allow free elections -  has and will continue to commit far greater crimes than anything being committed by ""the empire in decline."" If you don't believe me, go to your favorite search engine or Wikipedia and read about the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution, and the Tiananmen Square massacre. While the Chinese leadership is more capitalist these days, they are not merciful leaders, especially to their own people.            "
"          China is going through an industrial revolution. There will be pollution. Look up how environmentally friendly the west was through its corresponding phase. The chinese are at least trying to produce efficient and somewhat greenish power. Look at all the nuke and hydro plants they are building, trying to get away from burning coal. I don't see that happening in the United States.The chinese genocides and massacres you mentioned were indeed genocides and massacres. No argument from me there.And while China is indeed a dictatorship, it is not really communist anymore, other than in name. The U.S. in fact looks a lot more, if not communist then at least socialist, than China these days.The epithet ""Communist China"" seems to be mainly used by Americans looking to recall their own long-gone glory days of freedom and capitalism.On the Chinese regime's crimes, it is also worth noting that they were mainly perpetrated internally, inside China. While this clearly doesn't excuse them, I prefer this over a regime that tries to control the entire world.The crimes mentioned are also in the past. Again, this is no excuse for those who committed them. But let's focus on what is happening today, lest we end up debating slavery, or what have you...For the record, I am quite pro-American, as intended by the founders and in the spirit of the Declaration of Independence.

"Dawn, this is beautifully created!  I am both humbled and honored by your presentation of my blog and efforts!
Thank you also for including the Sandhill crane hunt issue in TN.  If this hunt proposal succeeds, it will be the first time in history that a hunt season has opened on the eastern population of sandhill cranes.  TN is only the beginning.  Kentucky is facing the same issue and watching TN’s results; MN and WI, who have been pushing for this hunt issue, are watching also.    
There is an easy link provided for comments with handy points to make in your email on my Sandhill Family blog post:  http://vickiehenderson.blogspot.com/2010/11/sandhill-crane-hunting-in-tennessee_24.html

"          I can't believe you took it off - shouldn't it be a person's decision whether they want to see spoilers before the movie? I mean from the trailers and spoilers that I've seen so far you've pretty much butchered the whole plot and characters anyway so why not throw a little more crap on the pile?! why deny the public more of the lame mantra's and pathetic one-liners that are already circulating and infecting the way a person views the characters and their personalities? The story becomes less and less engaging and believable with every turn of phrase that leave the supposed to be century old vampire's mouths - why would Edward say to Bella 'you better hold on tight spider monkey'? He wouldn't. Its completely forgetting the point that Edward was supposed to have been around 90 years ago where such stupid comparatives were not even thought of. Kind of killing the mystic to Edward's character just to gain a few laughs from the desperate 40 year olds who are so deprived of life they'll laugh at anything that could possibly be deemed 'amusing' - not really the audience you were going for I'm sure.

"          omg why the ##### did you have to tempt me with that lol. i watched like 10 seconds of the first one and the decided not to watch any more but omg i cant wait until the movie comes out!!!!!!!!!!            "
"          I didn't even try to resist :lol The trees and piano scene just took my breath away! The filmakers and actors really did a great job. I was worried about how bella's lullaby would sound based on the soundtrack reviews, but the version they had in the clip flowed seamlessly. 
For those of you who didn't see the clip, you won't be disappointed.            "

"          Okay, so I didn't even try to resist... I mean, Im trying to see as much of the movie as I can b4 it comes out so I don't just COMPLETELY freak when I see it on the big screen, b/c I freak out so much every time I see a new clip, that I'm really worried about how seeing the entire movie is gonna affect me, so Im trying to watch as much as possible beforehand so I can actually watch the movie when it comes out instead of just, like, hyperventilating the whole time.  And, just fyi, it really wasnt 8 minutes of new footage, it was more like 4 minutes (at the most), the rest was stuff from the Penelope DVD footage, which I know I (and a lot of other ppl) had already seen.  
 
But, Im not gonna say much about the footage, b/c I dont wanna ruin it 4 ppl who are much stronger than me and have decided to resist the temptation to watch it. However, I will say this: I LOVED IT!!!! This movie is completely exceeding my expectations from what I've seen so far, and that is SO awesome!!! OME Robert Pattinson is the BEST, most PERFECT Edward ever. He is just AMAZING in the footage- his facial expressions and tone of voice add SO much to Edward's character, like I feel like I know Edward more from seeing him in the movie than I do from reading about him in the book, and that's really saying something. He's just- wow. That's all I can say- WOW. and the chemistry is amazing between him and Bella/Kstew. PERFECT. I was literally in tears at the end of the footage, it was so sweet and sad and happy all at the same time... I can't explain it, but it was SO good it made me cry. OME this movie is gonna be the BEST MOVIE EVER!!! (and I think I'm gonna see it WAYYYY more than 3 times in theaters- that was my original prediction, but I think I'm gonna have to change that to, like, 10 or more, considering I've watched that footage 5 times already- and I just watched it for the first time an hour ago or less. oh and btw, if it's up to me they can keep bringing on the spoilers, b/c each one only makes me MORE excited for the movie (if that's even possible); it most definitely does NOT decrease my excitement in any way, shape, or form :).            "
"          I have to admit.I've watched the first one.But that's okay because in 48 days i'm going to forget about it (yea right) I love it ! Although,one part is kinda bad....            "
"          Hey Nicki..i think that Australia is the best country in the world...but not when we're made to wait till dec 11 to see twilight! It totally blows!
But i didn't watch the new footage cos i know my hubby would pay me out for it, cos he thinks we've seen enough with all of the other trailers. Its like peeking at a christmas present...and i'm not gonna look 'til the big day :-)

I will see it at midnight and i cant wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!            "
"          Ok so I didn't even try to resist!! It was so awesome and hilarious!!! It doesn't give away anything and I agree with K@tie it's not like we don't know what happens, right?! That 8:20 clip will last me until the movie is released although I do hope they release one of better quality. Power to those who resist!! I know I couldn't!!!!!            "
"          Yeah I watched them... but in Australia it comes out on December 11, so it's just too hard for me to wait!  You guys only have 20 days to go, i've got to wait double that!
Although watching Twilight with these poor quality clips is a little annoying... I am just as excited (if not more) to see it when it comes out on the big screen!            "
"          Ohh! I confess...I watched them!!! I have no willpower haha! Love it! I am so ready to see this movie!!!            "
"          :D is so so so so so tempting....but I will wait until the movie comes out.

I hope the spoilers do not stay on to long. The trailers have already have given so many important parts of the movie.

I will be as strong as Edward and I will resist the temptation

I salute your selfless sacrifice... May your family find peace and happiness, and live with your memory forever. Chris, I am not a religious man. I am not sure what exists.

"          Most police I have seen working, and I'm afraid my experience is limited to witnessing how the beat cops do what they do (sometimes in tough areas, like East Village, and the Barrio Logan problem areas adjacent to the East Village), most of them are terrific people who serve as role models for the rest of us.  I'm a bit older, 56, and we get more conservative I guess as we grow older, more sentimental about our institutions and such, so I don't want to sugarcoat problems that are encountered with our folks in blue. But honestly, they get mostly criticism, are rarely praised, and often second-guessed by some who would not be fit to hold their old sneakers.  This officer, and his lovely family...just take a look, the kids are terrific, the (ex) wife loving and solid behind him, and the stories of his actions and caring about his community an example to us all. We'll all mourn the loss of this fine man, and pray for his family's grief, that they will find a way to get through all this, and to continue with the example he set.    God bless the folks in blue. Today, they have earned our respect and deserve every dime they get on the job. Please, let's not cut the budget and put the officers on the street under any more pressure, or danger, for lack of back-up. Chris was 'good cover.'  Having been in the military, I know that that is the highest compliment you can pay your fellow soldier...I would pick him to be beside me in the trenches, anytime.

"          Any chance the increased opponents' free throws and stingy D are related?  Granted, there have been some dumb fouls, but maybe a byproduct of playing tough aggressive D with a young team is that it takes guys longer to get a feel for where refs are drawing the line.  Along these lines, I'd be okay with the high free throw numbers if it meant the rest of the time the other team is getting seriously hounded on our end of the court.Overall, considering plenty of teams start with cupcake schedules, this is certainly encouraging.

"          That is something I was going to mention also. I think the high free throw rate can be attributed partly to a youngish team learning how to play aggressive D without fouling, move your feet hands up guys. The other part has to be officials, they have been calling the game so tight in the first few games and some of the calls, regardless whether they are in our favor or not, are making me scratch my head.

"          The Hoosiers' defense this year has vastly improved from years past.  Honestly, I think a lot of this comes from VO.  The intensity and passion he brings to the floor every game makes the rest of the team around him better.  Seriously, how often do you see a player pick up their player full court and really pressure them anymore?  Not much.  But VO does that and causes stress for whoever is up against him and causes them to rush or panic resulting in turnovers.            "

"          I know the team still fouls, but there were a few games where the refs were just terrible. Literally calling fouls when no contact was made at all. I think NCAA officiating is getting worse rather than better.

The defense has to be better with the kids getting stronger. JR is buying into it, VO is just natural at it. What kind of difference would Guy make in that category? We still give away too many layups.

I think Sheehey may be the biggest surprise for me thus far. It seems like everything he does is productive. Always in the right place. Just a high basketball IQ. Plus he has a little 'tude. I saw a player trying to get his hands on him before an in-bound and Will shoved his hands away three times. The kid has courage. And probably needs more minutes. Can't wait until Will and VO are comfy with the jumper. They have the ability, but still have a few jitters.            "

 My favorite example was 23 worse fares for a MKE-MIA Delta flight -nicely done.

"          Not that I don't like Hipmunk, but it fundamentally reflects a minor enhancement to the ITA Software Matrix 2 time bar display format.

Given that the content is based on output from the ITA QPX engine, other group like Orbitz itself, Kayak, Bing, FareCompare, Fly.com or TripAdvisor could easily replicate the basic enhancements.  

This also excludes any enhancements planned by Google with its pending acquisition of ITA Software.

Here is what I see makes Hipmunk different, and why this degree of differentiation may present a problem:

Booking – ITA is a pure tech play, but Kayak can beat Hipmunk by offering true airline meta-search to expand beyond just Orbitz for ticketing.

Agony Filter – A basic compound price/duration filter, this was done long ago by Expedia for its Best Fare Search, Neat Group for Dynamic Packaging and SideStep for its initial air search results display.  A relatively simplistic algorithm to create.

Saving Previous Itineraries – done by lots of travel web sites, again, for several years.  Not a significant barrier for a competitor.

Filtering Undesirable Code Share Flights – I like this feature, especially its toggling capability.  Unfortunately, as this is based on the attributes passed by the QPX engine, again, this is relatively easy for others to accomplish with minimal development effort.

One burning question is why Hipmunk did not include the Matrix display format above the time bar display.  The matrix, used effectively by Orbitz, enables very simple filtering by stops and carrier that seem to be missing from Hipmunk.

Also, inclusion of Kayak-style filters would have been very beneficial as they are now the norm for most travel websites.

One persnickety point, why didn’t Hipmunk have the flight details display when hovering over the select button?  Easy to code as they already do it over the time bars – ITA did it that way.

In summary, Hipmunk is a nice site – it has provided some incremental improvements to the air search process by incorporating several features that have been inexistence on various sites for a considerable period of time.

The challenge for Hipmunk will be the ability for a large number of competitors to quickly and inexpensively implement these UI and sort/filtering upgrades for the benefit of much larger groups of users.

The question for Hipmunk will be if it can pull users from the other sites before they can react and enhance their interfaces.

To me, that seems like a lot of money, without much time – and that is a tricky combination for any start-up.            "
"          ""Finding the right flight often takes all afternoon—or all week.""
 
 Wrong.  MAYBE 30 minutes, certainly no longer.  5 minutes to find the three best flights and the rest of the time to click on each flight to see if seats with power are available, aisle seats are available, etc..  
 
 The display looks nicer than a typical text-based listing of flights, but I think the problem is overstated and I think this is a nice feature for travel websites – but not the foundation for a company.  
 
 If I'm a travel site, why wouldn't I pay 1 or 2 web designers to copy this format?  Where is the sustainable differentiation and what kind of exit is imagined?            "

"          I don't understand ""it takes hours to find a flight""?

 If you take a 30 minute connection, your chances of missing the connection are very high, which has a rather high penalty, yet the service assumes any shorter flight dominates a longer flight in goodness.
 
 I've been developing a flight search algorithm that takes historical flight delay information into account when looking at connecting flights.  It also does point-to-point planning - allowing a more distant airport to win if the flight is cheap enough.
 
 This is all balanced out by having the user enter how much their time is worth.

"          For everyone posting ""Verizon fail"".... SHUT UP!! really, what is wrong with you people.  You paid for a phone (one of the best on the market btw) with Android 2.1.  The phone and OS are not perfect, but its really one of the best you can get.  Now, FOR FREE, you are getting an update that will have things to make it better, new features, again, FOR FREE!  They are taking as long as they are so they can make sure that it is as bug free as it can be.  Why? Because all you people who complain that its not on your phone yet would be the first to complain when there is a lock, or a bug.  And it makes PERFECT sense that the new phones will ship with 2.2, because its done.  If they ship new phones with 2.1, then that just adds more phones that would need to get an over the air update, that will make it take longer over all.  What should they do?  Not ship anymore phones until YOU have your 2.2?  Or just add to the volume of 2.2 updates that need to go out over the next week or so? People, please, stop being kids and wait for the free update that is already on its way.            "

"          Verizon fanboy, if they're shipping new DIncs with 2.2 because it's done then why are they sloooowly rolling it out. If it's done well enough to ship on newer units then release it already and make it downloadable to manually install. Why shouldn't we be able to loaded it manually and have to wait for those slow ass mofos at Verizon. And all those assclowns that said they got the OTA and are loving the Froyoness I'm yet to see a single screen shot of proof I think everyone's full of shiiit.            "
"          Let me understand this... you feel that its bull shit that Froyo is going out there because YOU haven't seen a screen shot?  Trust me, I'm no fan boy, just using logic.  It takes time and A LOT bandwidth to push full OS updates to hundreds of thousands of units. I'm a video game developer, trust me I know software, but most people who own the phone don't.  To be as good to the costumer as they can, Verizon is pushing the OS to phones so the end user just has to hit ""ok"" and they will have the OS with no hang ups.  As far as not just putting it out there for manual install?  I would BET it has to do with one thing.  If they do, people who don't know what they are doing will brick their phones left and right if they mess something up. (happens all the time with the rooted phones) Its easier on them and the tech support team to just slowly pass it out.            "

"          A note to all: I came to Droid X from Blackberry and I am absolutely thrilled with my new Verizon Droid X. I took an onslaught of attacks from my BB forum members but I am here to say the Droid is a huge upgrade from the Blackberry experience.For all your still running on 2.1. I recently installed the leaked 2.2 Froyo OS and there is a HUGE improvement in battery performance. So much that I am not inclined to root at this time just to remove the bloatware. On 2.1 I got a half day of battery performance and had to connect the phone to the charger. On 2.2 I simply turned off the GPS / Bluetooth, Wifi, Airplane modes when not in use, removed all unnecessary widgets, and I am getting a FULL days used with life to spare. Having come from the Storm, I will tell you I endured almost a full year of waiting before getting the necessary upgrades and beta OS version to get the Storm to run acceptably. From the outset, my Droid X outperformed my Storm. On 2.1 the battery life was disappointing but that really is the only complaint I had about my Droid. With 2.2 I am completely satisfied with the phone's basic operations. I will say this, as I said previously in Blackberry forums. Above all, the Droid is a cellular phone. If you are making phone calls, receiving voice mail, and sending sms/mms messages, you have absolutely nothing legitimate to complain about otherwise. If you want to play games - buy a gaming device. If you want driving directions - purchase a GPS unit, and if you want to take photos - buy a digital camera. That the Droid performs these tasks in addition to making phone calls is highly commendable. If you are using these features and have to recharge the phone mid day - do so with a smile on your face. The Droid performs all those tasks and more. If you have an issue with battery life, blame battery technology and not the Droid. The Droid is performing these tasks and such tasks place a heavy demand on the processor which requires energy. Nuff said.DROID RULES!!!!            "

In less than two months, Glenda Sue has drawn from her pool of personal artistic friends from around the country and filled an empty room with beautiful products.  REB is not just an ordinary retail shop, but an exciting wonderland with imaginative furniture ten-feet tall with angel wings, the Moses sofa and chairs with animal skins and velvet, and a diamond-shaped carved table with four gigantic banquettes to seat eight (or 12 kids!) will blow you away.  There are beds and a 900-pound California burlwood sofa and coffee table that’s knock-down gorgeous!  She’s introducing Wichita to David Blow with imaginative artwork that combines nature and technology and Betsy Miller with her series of pastel Shrimp Boats.  Tucked here and there are one-of-a-kind, handmade fashion and home accessories—adorable dramatic lampshades and jewelry and bags, “sparkly” clothes, and designer pieces—all REASONABLY priced.  There is something for everyone—a little girl’s tutu, plus sizes, even the best garlic powder you’ve ever tasted.   Rare Exotic Boutique extends the glamour and charm of Old Town to the Home Interior Designers and fashion-conscious homemakers of Wichita culture.  Not just art, but world class art.  Can you imagine real hand-dug redwood in an age of particle board and glue and the return of the American buffalo on chairs and ottomans?  How about clothing from top designers that shy from world market “me too” clones?  Isn’t that what David Burk of Old Town envisioned when he invested to bring a new heart and energy to the Old Wichita commerce center--the American heartland of aircraft, oil and cattle?   If marketing history teaches us anything, it is that the market grows four times when one store grows to two stores.  The starburst in quaint Old Town brings synergistic trade and an exciting fellowship of funky to fabulous, sassy to classy, and bodacious to beautiful.  Ribbon cutting for the official Grand Opening is Friday, April 23, at 4:00 p.m., with an on-going registration to win a one night stay at the Hyatt Regency with a complimentary dinner for two.

A number of the stories we do are from people who have turned their life around from low to high, and the icing on the cake of their story is them feeling inspired to start their own business. Their own personal story and history is a part of their business brand.

For instance, we placed a story in the Daily Mail and Woman’s Own on two women who had started an events business together – and incredibly they met when one of their husbands had an affair with the other one. So it was wife number 1 and wife number 2 who were now in business together. That's obviously an unusual one though. We’ve also done stories of people who’ve started businesses after beating illness.

"          Woo hoo! Been waiting with baited things for your analysis of last week's announcements Rafe, especially for what was quite a Mahoosive strategy change (well publicly anyway even if they've been drifting this way for a while as you and Julien Fourgeaud had presciently predicted.). First off I kind of welcome this change as it removes an artificial separation between app development for Symbian and Meego that had to be to the disadvantage of both particularly when Nokia needs to make sure the other major app ecosystems don't disappear over the horizon. It also clarifies the story, however I have a number of points, queries and observations that remain unclear in my mind that I think I'll just put out there in a free form sort of a way. I realise and hope that those many better informed in this area than me will add in their more valuable commentary.Clearly (despite denials and evasion S^4 development was going off course, the artist formerly known as S^3 was late to the party and even in the Foundation meeting minutes it was apparent that S^4 was getting pushed waayy down the road - well over I would guess six months later than is original scheduled date of end of this years. However the break between the two of them had already caused some (many) to hesitate in their S^3 device purchases fearing that they were going to be left on an abandoned platform (as S1 has become to some extent because of the issues running/installing Qt on some of it's devices) however with S^4 now looking to be nine months away could Nokia withstand that period of consumers ""holding fire"" and secondly would they have been able to withstand that period of criticism of every device they released being seriously downrated because of the OS (UI) - pretty much 80% (probably more) of the reviews I've seen have said great hardware let down by horrible fiddly OS (which I kind of expected all year) As a shareholder I have to deprecate the waste of time the Symbian Foundation has been (not a criticism of the individuals but of the strategy and mostly the timing and realism of it) and the second waste of time in S^4 development that now seems to be going to be written off. However I guess I applaud Nokia for having the balls to correct their course (once again)There are a huge number of queries though:Have Nokia finally made up their mind this time having veered all over the road in the last few years and are they going to stick to their strategy for more than 18months? I can understand why they have lost respect and developer interest and this could just turn out to be yet another ""exciting new initiative"". I do kind of like the whole Qt story and obviously reading Rafe'S and other's opinion pieces on this Nokia have obviously been moving strongly towards a Qt centric approach.How long is this all going to take? There have been ridiculous time wasting distractions already and it's beyond urgent that the UI is fixed (this I think has gone over at the top levels).Nokia have missed two major commitments to shareholders - the second step change in Symbian (S3 was meant to be before half year) and the next/final step in Maemo/Meego. What are the realistic (for a change) timetables on delivery of promises now? I guess this as much as anything has cost much of the senior management so recently departed their roles after categorical promises to deliver, investors don't like being bullshitted.How are they actually going to deliver these upgrades what happens to the improved hardware platform planned for S^4 devices i.e. will improvements now be ""throttled down"" so they are deliverable on the not overly ambitious (bare minimum) hardware platform of the current S^3 devices? Bearing in mind many of their rivals are probably going to start delivering dual core devices next year and Nokia once again is at the bottom and just scraping by on platform.How are they going to ensure a unified platform experience, a bit of a biggie. if all the releases keep coming out how are they going to give a consistent UI feel and methodology? At the moment on S1 all the various new components (Maps, EMail/Messaging etc.) all have an almost completely different UI and various different tasks even in the main body of the UI act in different ways. This UI inconsistency is one of my main bugbears (it requires to much concentration like Windows Mobile to do tasks in S1 and too much effort of memory as to how each part of the UI works or where each arcane setting is buried. Much work needed to be done on this and I'm not clear how a rolling upgrade programme is going to deliver this. It's going to require a very clear view of what the UI is finally going to be like and rigorous enforcement of that view in all the various iterative updates that this move seems to imply. A vision and consistency generally absent from Nokia's software efforts so far.At the moment although I like the idea on the surface it also seems slightly chaotic in that Nokia haven't really fleshed out the implications of abandoning a lot of the public work on S^4 and what they're they're going to bring now and what it will look like. Even the announcement was a bit shambolic with the dropping of UIMEO seeping out via forums and gathering various strands and the retention of AVKON is a surprise however legacy/dormant it may become it is a bit of a volte face.I guess what I'm saying is that the message is confusing (well to me) and there seem a number of untold stories at a moment when I feel Nokia's message needs to be crystal clear about where they're headed and show us (finally finally finally) and improved UI contemporary to 2011 (as I guess it will be) not 2009 and not just improved components (browser etc.) but a genuinely improved and easier experience. Frankly rather than messing around with HDMI etc. time would have been better spent here I feel.Lastly and this is not said in a hostile way at all (and is something that Rafe and Julien have alluded to) I guess this is the end of Symbian as a visible ""above the surface"" OS rather than the stuff paddling underwater and I suppose the beginning of the Nokia Experience OS - Let's hope they can get it sorted a bit faster.Three years and counting and nothing Earth shattering so far, Andoid 3 and iOS5 will be here by the time they get their next step underway by the looks of things not forgetting the other developments their rivals are going to deliver. Nokia need something to put some of their devices and one of their platforms (although I guess all platforms are unified under the ""Precious"" Qt) at the forefront in people's minds and experiences.            "
"          I think the key point here for you coming out of all these announcements, is unification of efforts. Prior to this, Symbian itself was a fragmented platform. Each device had Symbian retooled _for that device_. Now Symbian is truly becoming one platform. The same S^3 baseline will be going on all Symbian devices going forwards. This follows along with the Qt story as well. Focus of the applications will be unified, so that calendar, mail, SMS, media players etc, will be one set of source code, for both Symbian and Meego going forwards. This unification will have a huge effect on stopping the massive dose of headless chickenism that's plagued Nokia for the last couple of years.Good solid stories are finally starting to emerge, and above and beyond that, smart stories. Consistency of code base, will ensure consistency of platform. Aside from that, Qt and QML are just that much easier to get things done in. From my POV, this is probably one of the best strategies that could have been implemented to get Nokia back on track, and the juggernaut going forwards instead of sitting spinning it's wheels.Mr Elop has a lot of experience with leading Qt development (see the microsoft office on symbian project), this has been a very well informed decision on his behalf, and I think personally an incredibly smart one, one that'll probably save nokia's hide.

"          Great article. I hope everyone notes some key points here:

Symbian is easily technically the best OS out there, Android, iOS, BB and WinPho aren't even close, they really aren't.

It now has a competitive UI that can easily and quickly get better (and already is according to someone who's seen the N8's first software update pre release)

Symbian has a long and assured future ahead of it as the world's dominant smartphone platform.

Hopefully some of the negative nonsense people spout about Nokia and Symbian will now stop!            "
"          ""Technically"". I knew it, Symbian fans are SO predictable. HOW, pray tell? What is there beneath the FUGLY Symbian desktops that I am too blind/stupid to see? And how other platforms don't even come close? Try using some non-Nokia handsets first - it might refine your outlook somewhat. ALso, I have my doubts about N8 UI getting quickly better. Because my mate, buddy, fella, the 'improvements' that would be introduced to N8 months down the line were already there in other platforms EONS ago. Hell, even Maemo was miles better and it would have run so well on today's hardware. I agree about the negative nonsense, but see, it only springs because of such statements - i.e. 'positive nonsense'.            "
"          I am not sure if you are either too stupid or blind, like you offered yourself. Then again, being too blind is odd in itself, as opposed to just a little blind? ""Technically"" means exactly what you thought it meant. Under the ""FUGLY"" UI layer, the core OS is really the most resource efficient and functionally rich mobile OS out there. Other platforms do not come close. It is in the article btw. What you are complaining about is the UI, and I agree with you there. They have the technology and resources to make that much better quickly, but so far have not done so.            "
"          That's all fine, but you're simply wrong. Pure and simple. See my reply above to Mashy re: what Symbian's technical superiority means for the end user.As for UI improvements these can and will be done easily and quickly, and in any case it doesn't need them. Symbian is now easily competitive with other platforms, beating them in some respects (iPhone for example is now where Symbian was several years ago in terms of UI structure). Symbian UI is more flexible and powerful than Android, AND is fine on cheaper hardware.            "
"          ""As for UI improvements these can and will be done easily and quickly""Really??1. If it can be done ""easily and quickly"", why haven't Nokia done so already? Because it certainly has not been done because of lack of time...2. If it's only recently that this can be done ""easily and quickly"", please name what features now allows that, besides from Qt which, on Symbian, is currently more of a nice idea than an solution with real results? Also, 3rd party apps based on Qt is one thing, but that the built-in apps will use it any time soon is very different.3.

"          please put some light as to how 'symbian is easily technically the best OS out there' affect the end user? thanks.            "
"          How it affects the end user? Well, take a technically poor OS like Android. Running on a virtual machine layer means the processor has to do WAY more work. This work eats battery, so you need a bigger battery to have the same battery life as something running a better OS (e.g. N8). It also means you need a much faster processor to give the same performance as it's having to break through the virtual machine layer to get any work done.So: worse battery life = need for bigger, more expensive battery OR crap battery life. Faster processor required = much more expensive. Hence why Android phones are overpriced and underperform. ALWAYS.Apple's iOS used on the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch is also poor for battery life relative to the N8 and other Nokia phones (despite Apple's BS to the contrary). iOS simply hasn't had the engineering skill and maturity and time put into it that Symbian has which is miles ahead in power/performance/cost ratio.So, in summary, in Nokia phones (esp. Symbian), the consumer gets a more powerful phone for a much cheaper price, and probably smaller/thinner/lighter too if the designers want to. That is a GREAT win for consumers.            "
"          I'm sorry, but you're absolutely wrong about iOS battery life.  My wife has an iPhone 4 and I'm not sure I've ever seen a smartphone that gets better battery life than that one does.  And I've used LOTS of smartphones (E71, N97 mini, Palm Pre+, Nexus One, iPhone 3GS).

"          do still remember the slogan of iphone 3g? twice as fast. apple meant it in battery draining as well.iphone 4 battery is good if you keep minimum or near minimum brightness. Full brightness and a little above moderate usage and it wont last a day.            "
"          Android System Checker on my phone shows battery consumption is 4% by the OS and 3% by the Android system. Most power is taken by cell standby (30%) and Display (13%) most of the rest is idle consumption. So, I don't think it is the OS that makes that big a difference. But experience does show that Android phones are the very worst performers for battery life. Symbian coding with its descriptors et al is an efficient user of memory etc. But as for technically better? Well yes, its a native executor rather than Darvik etc. Sacrifices the flexibility of a VM for a bit of performance. An advantage is that it will fucntion on lesser hardware. I dislike Android because it is such a disappointment, I expected it to be much much better than Symbian UI. It plainly isn't much better. I am stuck with a crappy phone for a while yet, but I won't be staying with Android once I can free myself.Another good thing about Symbian is the feeling of not selling out with the sheep masses. Even though it is more popular it somehow feels a bit different to go against the flow.            "

"          The point is that a Symbian phone with the same feature set will run longer and on lesser hardware than a phone with a different OS.            "
"          Maybe so, but who cares about running on lesser, cheaper hardware if it means a severely compromised user experience? My 5800XM was pretty cheap to buy, it has 128mb of RAM and a 434mhz CPU but it runs punishingly slowly, 3 seconds+ to open main menu, screen rotation takes a few seconds, camera takes 5+seconds to open and be ready to shoot, new comments system on here lags the browser to the point where it's unusable, my gallery with 400 photos in takes 60+ seconds to appear when I open the app. I get frequent out of memory errors.The N8 has 680mhz CPU, a GPU and 256mb of RAM. But it still suffers from lags and freezes, even moderate multitasking can cause noticeable slow downs in the phone...compare this to my HTC Desire, 1ghz CPU, 570 some odd MB of RAM. Never stutters, never freezes, auto screen rotation even when browsing a heavy website is near instantaneous, camera opens and is ready to shoot in about 2 seconds, main menu opens instantly, device search is instant, gallery with 500+ pictures opens in less than 5 seconds.Just what hardware will it take to make a Symbian device perform as fast and smoothly as a powerful Android or an iphone4 if 680mhz and 256mb RAM is not quite enough?Arguing Symbian is technically better like it means more than it actually does, with the OS as it currently stands in the user experience/UI stakes is like crossing the road when the little green man is telling you it's safe but you can clearly see a speeding vehicle that isn't going to stop and stepping out in front of it anyway because you're technically correct to cross the road because you have right of way; it's a moot argument that makes you feel warm and fuzzy but you're denying reality.

"          Here's a short version of what Rafe just posted.  Nokia has pulled the plug on Symbian^4 and has bet the future on MeeGo.  Since MeeGo is likely a year or two away from being ready as a mainstream OS on anything but the most advanced mobile hardware, they are fixing up the OS they have (Symbian^3) and making the two OSes as compatible with each other as possible by developing as much as possible on cross-platform Qt.  New management has realized that people don't like having to buy new phones all the time to get new software features, so they have promised that they'll do a better job of delivering software updates that add features.            "
"          That's not really what I said (but I think you already know that). People persistently want to play up the MeeGo replacing Symbian story. Sure in the high(est) end devices that's true in time. But those who really buy into this argument (i.e. taking it further, placing MeeGo on a pedestal) and fail to understand the two platform with unifying QT approach don't seem to understand the mobile industry (software strategy, product creation etc.) and/or focus with blinkers on high end devices. In my opinion Symbian and MeeGo should be seen as much more complimentary than they are generally perceived. I don't really understand why people (in general it seems to be amateur armchair analysts) seem so intent on insisting Symbian will only be on low end smartphones. I guess some of this is down to definitions.  Further the implicit implication of this argument seems to be that it is desirable to have one underlying OS. The whole point about Qt is that this is no longer really the case.MeeGo is without question a very exciting development for Nokia and has lots of potential. It is where Nokia will do much of its 'cool stuff' in the years to come. However just as happens now with high end devices this 'stuff' will be passed down to other devices. Indeed that transfer process will probably be much more rapid that it is now. Looking at the likely scenario in the next few years will probably see one or two MeeGo device in 2011. And then one or two in 2012. And the same is probably true on 2013 and 2014. It is possible that these might be joined by MeeGo device in new categories (e.g. Tablets). You only need to take one look at Nokia's device portfolio to realise that will only be a portion of Nokia's device range. The exact boundary point between Symbian and MeeGo is open to debate, but I would suggest we will continue to see lower high end device (like the N8) running on Symbian for some time to come. Further forward is more difficult to predict because of the fast moving pace of the mobile industry. The boundary point may change, but it may not (this will be driven by commercial considerations rather than technical). What you can say is that both Symbian and MeeGo devices will be selling in much greater number than they are now.Personally I think the Series 40 comparison isn't really valid, both because of the technical context, but also because the mobile industry is very different now than it was 10 years ago. While we on the subject of Series 40 the lack of attention paid to it in general is surprising - after all one in every four of every mobile phone sold (and I mean everyone, not just Nokia) runs Series 40. Ultimately which platform a devices runs on looks like it will become fairly meaningless (certainly more so than now). The vast majority of people certainly wont care (not that they really do now!).              (Edited by author 2 months ago)            "
"          well till Nokia realizes that no one gives a crap about low end trash they are fucked!!!!!!!! They need to stop releasing crap like N8 and release phones that matter. If they released snapdragon phones they would easily be superior to android and have thousands more apps than all other smartphone OSes. But BEACAUSE OF THE GARBAGE THEY RELEASED EVERY YEAR THE N97, N96 AND N8 AND N85 AND ALL THESE UNDERPOWERED CRASH IN UR POCKET PHONES THAT DO NOTHING MORE THAN FREEZE AND CRASH NO ONE TRUSTS NOKIA TO RELEASE A DEVICE THAT ISN'T GARBAGE. THEY NEED TO STOP MAKING PHONES AND LICENCE THEIR OS TO HTC AND OTHER MANUFACTURERS WHO ACTUALLY KNOW HOW TO MAKE PROPER PHONES!!!!!!!!!!!!            "

"          Rafe, this is a fantastic article and one that sums up things just right.  As usual, your predictions and analysis are usually right on the money and I can read them for free.  I have to pay some well known companies large sums of money to get their analysis and they are rarely right when it comes to Symbian...lol            "
"          @Rafe: What if Nokia had stuck to Maemo 5 (something that ran perfectly on one year old hardware) and kept on improving it? See, I am still in love with that UI and I think that represented everything positive about Nokia: thoughtfulness, visual polish, understatement. Also, it was not a horror show for Symbian users (like me) as well.            "
"          Well in a sense that's exactly what MeeGo is... But I assume you mean a more direct continuation... I think Maemo 5 had a number of gaps before it was consumer ready. These could have been filled, but the work is going into MeeGo. I think you'll see a certain amount of familiarity in the MeeGo UI and a Maemo users.It was attractive to power users (especially those with a Linux bent), but was no where near as accessible to most users as Symbian is. This is reflected in the relatively limited sales - around 300,000 I think - still a lot more than was expected though.The N900 was very much about what Nokia could learn from it. Hence the oft repeated step 4 of 5 description.            "
"          So Rafe, let me get this right...it's not ""All About Symbian"" anymore...it's ""All About Qt"".  Correct?            "
"          Well yes in a sense! But it hopefully goes without saying that Qt wont be that visible to ordinary consumers (nor will Symbian or MeeGo for that matter). Website naming is another topic altogether!            "
"          Rafe, I understand your frustrations but I beg to differ. Saying that ""it's meaningless which platform a device runs on"" is IMHO a little premature. People do want the best functionality in their devices, and it is clear that in the future high end Nokias will be running MeeGo. I'm sorry but as a mobile enthusiast I am not really interested in the low to mid end (as great as they might be). I am interested in the best possible functionality.Please allow me to quote Niklas Savander, Nokia's executive vice president and general manager for markets:""The N8 is not the highest-end product we're aiming for. MeeGo will definitely come above the Symbian range in terms of functionality.""Let me give you another Niklas quote:"" (if) you go down to the most common denominator and then you have a hundred-dollar user interface on a seven hundred-dollar device. So we will have to allow MeeGo to stretch the furthest out"".It is the Nokia executives saying MeeGo will be offering best functionality. You can't hide your head in the sand.Cheers!              (Edited by author 2 months ago)            "
"          You'll note I said 'looks like it will become fairly meaningless'.. . there's a future element to that and it is not an absolute. But I do think the underlying OS (core stuff) will become less important (there'll obviously be an exception amongst some high end users who will continue to debate what's 'best' ad nauseum). I don't agree its as simple as people wanted the best functionality in their devices. That's a technology led perspective. It should be people led. People want the device that does want they want best.And yes of course as a mobile enthusiast you want the best functionality and I expect you to gravitate towards MeeGo devices. However when looking at things like platform strategy you can't look only from this viewpoint. Every device matters...If you read my comment above you'll note I said MeeGo is where the 'cool' stuff is and we've noted both here and on All About MeeGo many times that Nokia is positioning MeeGo above Symbian. I don't think anyone would dispute this. This is why I described the N8 as being in the lower half of the high tier. The point I was making is that most armchair analysts are being way too optimistic about where the boundary between MeeGo and Symbian devices lies, mainly because they have a blinkered view of the market.            "
"          To be clear, I'm not suggesting this is a bad strategy.  It seems like the best course given where Nokia is right now and given everything they have invested in their OSes right now.  That said, I do think Nokia does need to keep an eye on Android and at least consider using it in limited circumstances (such as the US where Symbian has almost no installed base or brand recognition).

"          Cathy thanks for sharing.  I think it depends on how members are staying updated (via email digest or visiting the group page) and how many members a group has in general.  If there are lots of active members it is harder to get a question noticed.  A good group manager, however, should be moderating frequently and weighing in on discussions if they are valuable to the group, and that can help with visibility.  Also, posting discussions more consistently can help.  They haven't perfected the format, but over time I believe Groups will become easier to navigate.  For example, with the new ""Open Groups"" feature, my hope is that we'll see RSS feeds for groups.            "

California could be broke by July if voters reject a handful of upcoming budget proposals, the Los Angeles Times reports. Officials predict the state will fall as much as $23 billion short if the unpopular propositions fail. To save money, the state may commute the sentences of 38,000 “low-risk” prisoners—including all 19,000 illegal immigrants currently in custody in California, who would be turned over to immigration authorities.

"          Obama to Address Muslim World From Egypt 
Updated 2:25 p.m.
By Anne E. Kornblut and Glenn Kessler
President Obama will make his promised speech to the Muslim world from Egypt, a White House official said on Friday.

Obama pledged during the campaign to address the Muslim world from a Muslim capital within the first few months of taking office. Picking a site proved challenging for a range of reasons -- from diplomacy to security -- and the decision took longer than expected, with Obama commissioning options from a research team. 

Having settled on Egypt, the White House will announce soon that he is adding a stop there to an upcoming overseas trip, presumably his early June visit to Normandy for the anniversary of D-Day. 

Choosing Cairo will inevitably bring comparisons with a major speech that then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice gave there in 2005, urging democracy and reform in the Middle East.

In that speech, Rice specifically urged the Egyptian government to ""put its faith in its own people,"" calling on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to end violent attacks on pro-democracy demonstrators, stop ""arbitrary justice"" and lift emergency decrees allowing the police to break up gatherings of more than five people. She also made similar demands on Saudi Arabia, another close U.S. ally. However, Rice tempered her comments by saying the United States had ""every reason for humility"" because of its history of slavery and racism.

"          Here's an update on the Black Farmers/Pigford Case:

PRESIDENT OBAMA ANNOUNCES PLANS TO PROVIDE SETTLEMENT FUNDS FOR LAWSUIT BY BLACK FARMERS AGAINST USDA
  	USDA offers solution to long standing case by discriminated farmers
Washington, May 6, 2009 - Today President Obama announced his plans to include settlement funds for black farmers in the FY 2010 budget to bring closure to their long-standing lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

""This is an issue I worked on in the Senate, and I'm pleased that we are now able to close this chapter in the agency's history and move on,"" said Obama. ""My hope is that the farmers and their families who were denied access to USDA loans and programs will be made whole and will have the chance to rebuild their lives and their businesses.""

""I am very pleased that President Obama is taking swift action on this matter as it will help us chart a new course at USDA, one on which all USDA customers and employees are treated equally and fairly,"" said Vilsack.

In 1999, the USDA entered into a consent agreement with black farmers in which the agency agreed to pay farmers for past discrimination in lending and other USDA programs. Thousands of claims have been adjudicated, but thousands of other claims were not considered on their merits because problems with the notification and claims process hindered some farmers' ability to participate.

To deal with the remaining claims, Congress provided these farmers another avenue for restitution in the 2008 Farm Bill. For those who have claims that were not considered on the merits because the claim was found not to be timely, the 2008 Farm Bill provided the right to file a new claim in federal court. The total amount offered by the federal government, $1.25 billion, includes $100 million that served as a ""place holder"" in Section 14012 of the Farm Bill. 


Full article here: http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal...

Obama Foodorama interviewed John Boyd about this. Some quotes:
But today's settlement offer almost didn't happen.

""After the President got into office, they [administration officials] asked us to wait another two years, because of the state of the economy,"" Boyd told Obama Foodorama last night. ""I said--two years! Some of these people have waited a lifetime already!""

.....Boyd is pleased that the President has moved fairly rapidly to allocate money to settle Pigford, especially becasue last week the money being offered to the black farmers was $100 million. Still, Boyd said that $1.25 billion is still a fairly low sum.

""$2.7 billion is a better figure,"" Boyd said. ""We're talking about thousands of farmers, decades of discrimination, people losing their land and going bankrupt, people whose lives and livelihoods were ruined based on the color of their skin. If these farmers had been white, they would have had all the support USDA gives farmers, and I wouldn't still be working on this.""

+  TV networks try to diversify their night-owl lineups

Late-night TV could use some color.

Nothing proves that like NBC's game of talk-show musical chairs. In case you've actually been tuning out and turning in early, Jay Leno is stepping down as the host of ""The Tonight Show"" at the end of this month. His decision to do so has created an opportunity for two other men.

As it stands, Leno will move to 10 p.m. weeknights, Conan O'Brien will replace him at 11:30 p.m. as the new host of ""The Tonight Show,"" effective June 1, and O'Brien's replacement, ""Saturday Night Live"" alum Jimmy Fallon, is already hosting ""Late Night"" at 12:30 a.m. Meanwhile, over at CBS and ABC three other men are trying to usurp the three guys at NBC -- all of them white.

Todd Boyd, a professor of critical studies at the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts, says that comedian Arsenio Hall was the first and last person of color to dominate the late-night landscape (1989-1994). ""The legacy of Arsenio Hall stands as a benchmark,"" Boyd says.

But variety is coming.

Fox and basic cable networks TBS and E! Entertainment are giving late-night a much-needed infusion of diversity.

While Comedian Chelsea Handler already tickles night owls five nights a week with her 11 p.m. offering ""Chelsea Lately,"" which airs on E!, things will improve further on the late-night scene when TBS gives funnyman George Lopez a show that will air at 11 p.m. Monday through Thursday, beginning in November.

Last but not least, comedic actress Wanda Sykes will become the first African-American female late-night host. That Fox talk show will air every Saturday, beginning in the fall.

""Wanda is a great alternative voice to the current late-night landscape,"" says Kevin Reilly, Fox's entertainment president. ""She has the perfect personality for Fox, and we look forward to reinvigorating Saturday night TV with her.""

This is Sykes' second stint with Fox. Back in 2003, she headlined a short-lived sitcom called ""Wanda at Large."" Sykes will replace ""MadTV"" at 11 p.m., which, after 14 obnoxiously-funny seasons, will come to an end on May 16.

No word yet on what will happen to the host of Fox's ""Talkshow with Spike Feresten."" The show and its namesake have enjoyed three obscure years on the network every Saturday since 2006.

""People will always have a need for laughter,"" says Detroit-born comedian Byron Allen, who got his start in the business writing jokes for Jimmy ""JJ"" Walker alongside David Letterman and Leno, then young unknowns. Allen, 48, now hosts the syndicated show ""Comics Unleashed.""

""Can Jay make it at 10 p.m.? Sure he can. People want to laugh,"" Allen says. ""Can Wanda and George make it? Yes, because they are funny and late-night talk shows have become the final frontier for comedians who can no longer rely on sitcoms.""

But Boyd says Sykes and Lopez will offer too little, too late.

""Many others have tried and failed,"" says Boyd, bringing to mind attempts made by everyone from Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson to Keenan Ivory Wayans.

""Arsenio had the benefit of riding the wave of hip-hop culture as it was staging its (mainstream) takeover,"" he says. ""Television is a very different animal now and with so many other options available, success is not guaranteed."" 

Just like the NETWORKS FOUND so many AA NEWSCASTERS durin' the elections, THEY CAN FIND ""ONE-O'-US"" 2 do the ""late night GIG!""

"          rikyrah:  More thoughts on JUDGE Souter's replacement:

+   Obama’s High Court List Is Led by Women Judges and Politicians

President Barack Obama’s first U.S. Supreme Court appointment probably will be drawn from a group of women who have achieved prominence in the law or politics, ensuring more diversity and possibly more real-world experience for the high court.

The replacement for retiring Justice David Souter is likely to add a strong liberal voice as a counterweight to the conservative wing, while unlikely to alter the court’s philosophical balance.

“I think it’s a mortal lock” that it will be a woman, said Tom Goldstein, a Supreme Court lawyer with Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld in Washington. “It’s too hard for the president to explain why, given all the highly qualified women who could be Supreme Court justices, he didn’t pick one.”

Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the only woman among the nine justices. For 12 years, she served alongside the first woman on the court, Sandra Day O’Connor, who retired in 2005.

Obama has expressed a desire to bring about more diversity to the court, in experience and background as much as race or gender. One of the leading candidates, Governor Jennifer Granholm of Michigan, has made her mark in politics.

The justices are split ideologically, with Anthony Kennedy often the deciding vote, on such matters as abortion rights, racial preferences in the workplace and separation of church and state. Souter usually lined up with the liberals.

Obama has said he will choose someone with “a sharp and independent mind and a record of excellence and integrity.” He said he wants someone with an appreciation for “how our laws affect the daily realities of people’s lives.”

The announcement could come as early as next week. The Democratic president said he wants a successor for Souter, 69, to be in place when the court reconvenes in October.

Betting Favorites:
Betting overseas reflects the widespread belief Obama will appoint a woman.

Paddy Power Plc, Ireland’s largest bookmaker, says the favorites are federal appeals court Judges Sonia Sotomayor at odds of 13-8 and Diane Wood at 9-4. Solicitor General Elena Kagan, the Obama administration’s top courtroom lawyer, is at 4- 1.

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, at 100-1, and first lady Michelle Obama, at 500-1, are distinct long shots.

Following are profiles of some of the women who are considered by Supreme Court observers to be possible nominees:

Appellate Judge

– Diane Wood: At 58, she has been on the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals since 1995. Wood worked in the Justice Department’s antitrust division for two years before then-President Bill Clinton named her to the court.

Clinton Appointee

– Sonia Sotomayor: Appointed to the federal bench by Republican President George H.W. Bush in 1992 and promoted to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1998 by Clinton, a Democrat, Sotomayor, 54, would be the first Hispanic on the Supreme Court.

Legal Pragmatist

– Kathleen Sullivan: She is a pragmatist who sees both sides of an issue, said Laurence Tribe, Sullivan’s professor at Harvard Law School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and later her law partner.

Georgia Supreme Court

– Leah Ward Sears: She became the youngest person, at 38, and first woman to serve on the Georgia Supreme Court when Governor Zell Miller, a Democrat, appointed her in 1992. Now 53, she has been re-elected to the court three times and became chief justice in 2005.

– Elena Kagan: Dean of Harvard Law School since 2003, Kagan, 49, was confirmed in March as the first woman to serve as U.S. solicitor general, the government’s top advocate before the Supreme Court.

Career in Politics

– Jennifer Granholm: Her career largely has been in politics, not the judiciary, offering Obama a chance to diversify a court that has drawn all its members from the federal bench.

– Martha Minow: A Harvard Law School professor whose students have included Obama, she is an expert on human rights and the law and social change. She is a career academic whose writings are often cited by researchers.

– Pamela S. Karlan: The professor of public-interest law at Stanford Law School in Stanford, California, is a founder and co-director of the school’s Supreme Court Litigation Clinic, which takes cases to the court without charging clients.

– Ann C. Williams: The former federal prosecutor was appointed a federal judge by President Ronald Reagan in 1985. The Detroit-born Williams, 59, was named to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals by Clinton in 1999.

She is one of four women and the only black on the 15- member appeals court. A graduate of Wayne State University in Detroit, Williams holds a masters degree from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and graduated from Notre Dame Law School in South Bend, Indiana, in 1975. She was an assistant U.S. attorney in Chicago and led the Justice Department’s Organized Crime Task force for the North Central region of the U.S.

"          Black Men/White Women: Sølve Sundsbø Sex, Racism and Possibilities: Images of people of color and and white women are never unproblematic.  As much as we claim to live in a colorblind post racial world, such photos are always charged with our understanding of the ways in which  race and gender intersect.  Is it still art when are we are doing is recreating racist/sexist ideas?            "
"          After all of the images of the potential rape this photo seems comforting, until we ask the question what woman willingly embraces her rapist.   When the face of the black man is finally featured he is defiant; there is no tenderness to counteract the previous images of bestial posturing.  

I enjoyed your post, womanist.   In answer to your question ""what woman willingly embraces her rapist"" is that he is not the rapist....he is the ""raped"" - if you will.

He is not being portrayed as the violater of white womanhood, but the victim of the woman...her slave.   At least, that's how it looks to my eye.

He may be a rapist...but not with the white woman.  With her, all his carresses are tender and submissive, careful not to mar her easily bruised flesh.   This is appropriate for a slave.

For purely aesthetic reasons...I can understand where the artist was going with this.  The contrast in skin colour is pleasing...if simplistic.   The lighting is nice.   The shadow is dramatic.  But we all know it doesn't just go down like that.  There are conscious and subconscious beliefs being played out in the depiction...undercurrents about race.   It's not just hard vs soft, dark vs light or man vs woman.

I see the white woman who appears physically weaker being portrayed as the one in control.  In the first pic, she's the object of desire and much ""grasping"" by the black, male hands even though those black males are her ""victim"".   They desire the thing that assaults them.   They support the thing that enslaves them...that picture of them carrying Giselle also reminds me of the photo of 6 soldiers planting the American flag at Iwo Jima(flags of our fathers)...which bring up other levels of controversy.   The black men(soldiers) planting Giselle(American flag) triumphantly on foreign soil.

Maybe what I see has much to do with my own personal beliefs about race..and specifically black men with white women.

Regarding the Iwo Jimo conection......Certainly, I believe that Americans(white&black) revere the mythology of America, even while that mythology both sustains and assaults them..heavy on the assault.    But isn't that the lot of a slave?..to serve and need the thing that destroys him?

She nibbles his ear...the seductive annihilator.

But then again...maybe the photographer is just painting with light...and bodies.  But we know it never goes down like that.            "
"          Interesting position.  If she is indeed in control of the men then the interpretation changes completely.  If the men are her slaves rather than her submitting to their will I think it makes the images all the more racist.            "
"          womanistsmusings:  That was my FIRST thought when seeing the SECOND PIC!

HER EXPRESSION - - SHE'S IN CONTROL!!

Their - EXPRESSIONLESS - - THEY  R NOT!!

Annnnnd, THEY don't enjoy what's bein' DONE 2 THEM!!  BELITTLED!!            "
"          What's really sad is this photographer is probably quite arrogantly thinking that he shot some provocative, thought-provoking, artsy fartsy photos. This is a lame attempt at shock photography. Could the photographer BE more obvious?? Was he mad at all the attention Annie Liebowitz got with the Lebron/Gisele pics last year? Because this is SOOOO a ploy to get publicity. The photographer will be on with Matt Lauer by Tuesday.            "
"          As a Black man -- even as a Black man married to a White woman -- I couldn't help but notice the power and control possessed by Bunchden, while no matter the pose, the  anonymous men appear to be perpetually at her ""service"".   Another of the racial micro-inequities that majority society is privileged to ignore, while we must reconcile and deal with.            "

The Angels have had one of the toughest schedules, while the Rangers have one of the easier schedules. Because of their schedule, I predicted the Angels wouldn't be much better than a .500 team through May, and would get hot during that 14 game road trip. I didn't expect the Angels to make any kind of bug run until mid-July when their schedule eases up like it did in June. And while the Rangers are dying from heat exhaustion and fading, the Angels have a stretch from August 27 through September 16, where they will play 18 straight games against teams under .500. I predict 13-5. lolIf the Angels just win some series, and take off during those easy stretches in July and late August, they will be right there (if not past) Texas through the end.Plus, this season reminds me of 2004...

"          As you know, the Rangers just traded for Cliff Lee. The Angels need to counter if they want to have a chance to win the division this year. If not, just make some moves in the offseason and focus on next year.            "
"          Angels need to make a couple of moves for them to win the division this year.  Frandson, Wood, Mathis, and Rivera have not produced squat.  Sign Hank Blaylock to play 3B.  Look to make a trade for Carl Crawford and include Rivera, Bell, and another prospect. Another option,  include Kazmir OR Saunders and a prospect for Haren or Oswalt. Another option, Napoli, Bell, and a prospect for Adam Dunn.  Dunn would have to sign long term to complete the deal.  Just some thoughts.            "
"          Why do you want to trade away Napoli ? Is he really that awful ?            "
"          Napoli has been good but not great.  The Angels need a productive bat in the lineup with the loss of Morales to injury. The Nats would expect to get something good in return. Napoli can play 1st or catch.  He will hit for power but not for average.  Napoli is on course to hit about .250 25hr's and 75 rbi's this season.            "

"          I doubt Crawford is going anywhere this season            "
"          Seriously?The Rays are in a win now mode. They need Crawford. Unless they totally implode over the next 3 weeks you are not getting Crawford from the Rays - it's that simple. They also don't need Rivera as Jennings will just be called up to replace him.The Astros AND Diamondbacks are trying to shed money. Taking back Kazmir won't work for either of them. Kazmir has been AWFUL and has serious negative trade equity. Saunders is a potential option but he's probably too much to give up for Oswalt (assuming the Angels pick up Oswalt's entire contract) and not nearly enough for Haren. And while Haren and Oswalt both represent an upgrade over Saunders, it really isn't that much of a difference. Especially when you consider the increased cost ($10m+ more a year in payroll).Finally, Dunn should not require any blue-chip talent. He makes $12m/year. That's about what he is worth. If the Nats trade him it won't be for established ML talent OR top flight prospects. Napoli is significantly more valuable than Dunn (Napoli has beat Dunn in WAR EVERY YEAR, based on value per plate appearance, since his rookie year in 2006) given that he can catch, is under team control through next year, and is cheaper. And why would we sign Dunn long term to be the teams DH? Morales will be back next year. No way would I want a $12-14m/year DH - regardless of how good he is.I like acquiring Dunn - but not at the cost of Napoli. Assuming you can get Dunn for much less you have Napoli rotate at C/1B/DH. Dunn rotates at DH/1B. If Oswalt can come over through a Kazmir trade that would be great. My guess is that we would need to kick in $12m+ just to get rid of Kazmir. That makes Oswalt incredibly expensive.            "
"          Why risk the future for a rental? I think the Angels have played great with the absence of Morales, why not just take this season as it goes? Just wait until after the season to sure up the holes and add depth. It wouldn't be throwing in the towel, it just doesn't seem rational to trade off prospects for second tier rentals. Besides, what does Dunn offer over Napoli? Aren't they just feast or famine homerun hitters? Heck, aren't they both liabilities on defense? (Same applies to Fielder) No thanks!            "

With most of the deals ahead of him signed before the big economic collapse. Oswalt is a very nice pitcher (especially in the awful NL Central). Is he worth his paycheck ... maybe. Is he worth substantially more than his paycheck (requiring top talent in return) ... most definitely not.            "

"          Angels will trade Scott Kazmir + 6 million, Mark Trumbo, Bobby Wilson and Trevor Reckling to the Diamondbacks for Dan Haren and Adam LaRoche.  LOL No seriously I wrote this on halosheaven.  No shot, but still, not a bad idea.  THis would upgrade the Angels offense by moving LaRoche's hot 2nd half bat to 1B and Napoli to split C and DH.  This would counter the Rangers upgrade in rotation, it would rest the ice cold Hideki Matsui when Napoli DH's and would improve the Angels defense at 1B.The D-Backs would get a major league SP for a low price next year with the money kicked in, a power hitting 1B, a defensive stud catcher, and a 21 year old lefty in AAA with a high ceiling.            "
"          Way to go Reagins, way to top off a horrible season (from a managerial standpoint) for the Angels. I agree, the Angels need to make a move soon if they want to remain AL West Champs.Also, I like how nobody is talking about Mathis being way better than Napoli anymore. Hahaha, just goes to show that stats a few weeks into the season doesn't mean that the player will live up to that for the rest of the season. Same goes for Matsui, what a joke...            "
"          You cant blame Reagins how could he have forseen Morales breaking his leg or 90% of our lineup struggling especially since at a point last year they were all batting 300            "
"          But you can blame him for the terrible new acquisitions (Morales was all the Angels offense until he got hurt), for letting key players in the field and in the clubhouse leave, for laying back and not doing anything until this point to fix the obvious problems the Angels have, and for not planning a good season. A good GM needs to be prepared. You have to remember, the Rangers have played 3 games less than the Angels, we could be as far as 7 or 8 games behind if they keep playing as hot as they have.            "
"          yeah, because lackey and figgins are really tearing it up right now.  oh wait....            "
"          Reagins deserves the blame for letting Vlad go, for letting K-Rod go, for the terrible signings of Brian Fuentes and Fernando Rodney and the awful trade for Scott Kazmir in which we gave up far too much and took on too much money.However, Reagins also deserves credit for bringing in Torii Hunter, not giving in to John Lackey's demands, bringing in Juan Rivera at such a low price, and Maicer Izturis, and the signing of Joel Pineiro, who is paid half of Lackey but has outperformed him.  So far, I'd give Reagins a C.            "
"          You would rather being paying K-Rod? Really?Fuentes wasn't the answer, but that doesn't mean that K-Rod should have been back. With league adjustments Fuentes was K-Rods equal in 2009. The big difference is that Fuentes is gone after this season. Meanwhile K-Rod will be owed another year at $15m or 2 years at $29m. Ouch. I'm not happy AT ALL with Fuentes, but at least he signed for less money and less years.Vlad was toast. If you followed him for the past years you would have seen that he was finished. His OPS plummeted from his normal, consistent, 950 range down below 800 in 09. NOBODY, and I mean NOBODY predicted his 2010 season. Hard to fault Reagins for that. Conversely, Matsui has been a huge bag of fail. Also, not something predicted. Between the two players blowing through expectations it makes Reagins look bad in retrospect.Kazmir was a calculated risk that has not paid off. He was outstanding in 2009 as an Angel - arguably the most dominant pitcher in baseball over the last 2 months. Unfortunately, he choked in the playoffs and has been a disaster in 2010. Angels gave up a bunch of prospects but really nobody that hurts. S Rodriguez wasn't getting playing time (he was behind Aybar, Kendrick, Wood, and Izturis in the infield). Torres is having a great season but there were always questions on his size (175lbs and 5'10"") and age. Hindsight being what it is I'm sure the Angels would like this one back. However, at the time it was considered a solid move.It's really funny to me because you site Hunter's deal as a smart one. In my mind, that was the worst deal Reagins has made. Sure Hunter has been playing great. His 2.5 years so far have been the best 2.5 years of his career. You don't see that very often on players who roam CF and are going through their 32 - 35 YO seasons. The Angels have been EXTREMELY lucky with Hunter so far. Just crossing my fingers now as we still owe him 2 more years and $36m.Reagins has made some big mistakes (resigning Abreu instead of going harder after Holliday, spending money on Rodney when there were better bullpen options available, etc, etc). But he has managed to keep this team competitive while dealing with mistakes from the previous admin (Matthews and Speier). If not for a fluke injury to Morales, and below average performances from virtually EVERY starting offensive player, the Angels would be well on the way to another 90+ win season. Considering that's done on a $105m payroll, that's not bad.            "
"          This really doesnt say anything to me. SO they arent looking for a rental but that doesnt eliminate anyone. All they have to do is ask teams whether they would allow them to discuss an extension or not before a deal, kinda like the whole Roy Halladay thing. No biggie.            "
"          I would like to see the Angels get some help at 3B.  I know Iztruris comes back soon but he cannot play everyday.  Take a chance on Hank Blaylock.  Dan Haren and Adam LaRoche would be nice to have in a trade.  If the Angels can keep Napoli that would be even better.  According to a previous post Angel scouts have been watching Haren so hopefully something is brewin.  If the Angels can move/trade Kasmir, Wood, Reckling, and Trumbo and pay part of Kasmir's contract that would be good for the Dbacks as well.            "

"          Napoli has been good but not great.  The Angels need a productive bat in the lineup with the loss of Morales to injury. The Nats would expect to get something good in return. Napoli can play 1st or catch.  He will hit for power but not for average.  Napoli is on course to hit about .250 25hr's and 75 rbi's this season.            "

"          I doubt Crawford is going anywhere this season            "
"          Seriously?The Rays are in a win now mode. They need Crawford. Unless they totally implode over the next 3 weeks you are not getting Crawford from the Rays - it's that simple. They also don't need Rivera as Jennings will just be called up to replace him.The Astros AND Diamondbacks are trying to shed money. Taking back Kazmir won't work for either of them. Kazmir has been AWFUL and has serious negative trade equity. Saunders is a potential option but he's probably too much to give up for Oswalt (assuming the Angels pick up Oswalt's entire contract) and not nearly enough for Haren. And while Haren and Oswalt both represent an upgrade over Saunders, it really isn't that much of a difference. Especially when you consider the increased cost ($10m+ more a year in payroll).Finally, Dunn should not require any blue-chip talent. He makes $12m/year. That's about what he is worth. If the Nats trade him it won't be for established ML talent OR top flight prospects. Napoli is significantly more valuable than Dunn (Napoli has beat Dunn in WAR EVERY YEAR, based on value per plate appearance, since his rookie year in 2006) given that he can catch, is under team control through next year, and is cheaper. And why would we sign Dunn long term to be the teams DH? Morales will be back next year. No way would I want a $12-14m/year DH - regardless of how good he is.I like acquiring Dunn - but not at the cost of Napoli. Assuming you can get Dunn for much less you have Napoli rotate at C/1B/DH. Dunn rotates at DH/1B. If Oswalt can come over through a Kazmir trade that would be great. My guess is that we would need to kick in $12m+ just to get rid of Kazmir. That makes Oswalt incredibly expensive.            "
"          Why risk the future for a rental? I think the Angels have played great with the absence of Morales, why not just take this season as it goes? Just wait until after the season to sure up the holes and add depth. It wouldn't be throwing in the towel, it just doesn't seem rational to trade off prospects for second tier rentals. Besides, what does Dunn offer over Napoli? Aren't they just feast or famine homerun hitters? Heck, aren't they both liabilities on defense? (Same applies to Fielder) No thanks!            "

That's about what the Braves got for Vazquez. I can't even see the Angels taking on more payroll. They are at nearly 122 mill their highest ever.            "

"          We'd love to see how this plays out- whether Groupon Stores becomes a useful new customer acquisition tool and/or encouraging current customers to return.            "

"          Future of GroupOn pricing should be subscription based instead of the current method to get a large share out of each coupon sold. Businesses must be able to open their ""GroupOn store"" for monthly fee and do whatever promos they want. This provides cost predictability and control.As this article correctly points out, businesses do not want to keep attracting just the low willingness to pay customers or letting their high willingness to pay customers flock to this site.-rags            "
"          It appears that Groupon is providing a ""guarantee"" of sorts for each deal, not to mention some credit card / merchant services for these offers. So I would assume there is some variable pricing. I also envision that merchants will be able to opt for more traffic on their offers, in other words, plug their offer into the Groupon email ecosystem.            "
"          I think this is part of Groupon trying to help the vendors with customer retention after the deal. This gives the small mom and pop stores a structured mechanism to keep in touch with customers. I doubt it'll remain limited to deals only, and I doubt the quality of the deals will be as high as the groupon email offer, mostly because the audience is customers who already heard about the merchant / used the merchant and this is follow up marketing.

"          I agree. Btw, Groupon also provides a bunch of services to merchants that most people don't know about: http://www.grouponworks.com/me...            "
"          Good point Jim. At the same time, I feel that this is basic diligence and customer service that you should offer to your vendors. And something like ""Capacity Planning Tools"" is very much needed given the backlash they had in the past months re. unhappy vendors. But great article overall !            "

"          We eat at the dining room table for both breakfast and dinner - and lunch during the weekends.  Meals form moments in the day when we are togther without other distractions 9apart from the food!) and can talk and relax, away from the clutter of the kitchen or the business of the rest of the house.  The diningroom is also the focus of many a memorable dinner party.  During the day it gets used for a spot of quiet letter writing or working on the lap-top.  I would be lost without it.  We also have a dining tabel on the patio in the summer - if the weather is fine we eat out of door.I grew up in a home with three dining rooms - one for breakfast, one for lunch and one for dinner - each differently decorated and furnished and with its own special ambiance - now that was dining!

"          A very good dual use of a dining room in a period house is to install a billiard diner. These are very elegant pieces of furniture which allow formal dining or use of the same room as an elegant games room at other times. The room does need to be big enough as there is nothing worse than not having enough cue room but most period Edwardian or Victorian houses could accommodate a 6'x 3' version. Better for the playing experience is an 8' x 4' but this requires a larger room obviously. We worked out that a 7' x 3.5' was the best fit for us and this has proven to be perfect for both dining, seating 8, and playing, big enough for a challenge but with sufficient cue space all round. Various conversion mechanisms are available but the best involve removing the 3 or 5 top peices or leaves and this takes only a few minutes. The dual height mechanism means you raise the table for playing so there is no compromise to the game playing or the dining level experience. We tend to use our dining room every day, either for eating or as a games room and we are very happy we thought of this as otherwise it would be semi redundant space. It has proven to be a big hit with all family members and entertaining for guests. There is something nice about eating and then converting the room for a game of snooker afterwards.            "
"          A dining room can be multipurposed as well, don't forget. We love eating breakfast and dinner in ours, but equally enjoy reading/writing and working there. I can imagine taking down the load-bearing wall that separates it from the kitchen (replacing it with an embedded beam), but we enjoy the home as it is, so why bother?We have radical plans for our 3rd floor loft instead. Putting our money into projects that REALLY turn our cranks. Kitchen/Dining open space? Maybe... sometime... perhaps.I also agree with Paula and Doug Brain-Smith... fashions do so come and go.

"          Eat in the kitchen if you wish but why anyone would admit to ""taking out"" all the ground floor rooms in an Edwardian House is beyond belief. If you want open plan then buy a recently built house. We bought our house because of its boot-room etc. and love its idiosyncracies. Anyone who has owned properties for over 30 years as we have knows that fashions can and will change. What then?            "

"          Hello Michael,Thank you for such an informative blog post. I really appreciate the fact that you not only shared your personal experience with the new MySpace Music service abut also mentioned how this service is a good business model for the music industry. You mentioned, ""That 40% may be worth as much as $800 million already, on paper at least,"" where is this value coming? I was also wondering what your view was on the reports that Indie Acts were being left out of this deal and more importantly, were no longer being allowed to upload their music to MySpace. I understand the fact that MySpace is a new medium, which everyone wants to use because of the huge number of users that it has, but do you think that traditional advertisement by the record labels will ever stop? Will artists solely depend on their MySpace page or will there continue to be posters and other advertisement or their new music? You mentioned that all music should be free because anyone can copy a song, but what about the people that still want to physically own their music or for those who want to purchase legal downloads; would these users really be interested in being restricted to only being able to listen to music online on services such as MySpace Music? If the new way to go for music distribution is free, do you believe that record companies will just altogether stop manufacturing actual hard copies and solely distribute on ad-supported services, and if this is the case would they be willing to keep partnerships with Apple and other paid services, when they can just make a bigger profit with ad-supported services and not actually have to give any products to the end-user. If this is the case the music industry will be able to generate more revenue, solely by eliminating the costs that come along with manufacturing, distributing, and promoting physical copies of CD's. Seeing them from the artist's perspective, I do not know whether they would be happy to put in so much hard work into their productions when in fact they would not be able to see their final products in brick and mortar stores. I think that there is some nostalgia that comes along with seeing your final product in stores and therefore musicians would push to keep that distribution channel open. I believe that only time will tell how the music industry overcomes the downfalls that the digital age has brought, and we will just have to see and wait how users will react to MySpace Music.            "
"          As great as this new MySpace Music seems to be, I can't help but to think what musicians are thinking when they are telling them that their music is free. Is it just me or is there a difference between music being a free commodity vs a saturation of the market with mediocre music. Saturating the market with mediocre music and production is what led to the overall decrease of music sales. Iinstead of fixing the root of the issue, they are turning the music industry into TV II, free entertainment with advertising revenue. Musicians need to speak up. I understand that this is easier to monetise, but bands that are great and can connect with an audience are selling music, because people want to buy it. To conclude that there is no demand for music anymore is absurd.            "
"          I'm really surprised to see such a positive review of the MySpace Music here...I got all excited thinking maybe MySpace had done something right finally. But the search is terrible, as many have mentioned. Why when I search for a band do I get repeats of tracks, some of which have album art, others a generic MySpace logo? Why are some tracks only samples still? (Other services like Last.fm also have some full tracks and some samples, but they're clearly marked which is which before you start playing them.) NOT every song is addable to a playlist - I just pulled up a Silversun Pickups song, and the add to playlist button was greyed out. And so was the ""buy album"" button.Why can I not click on the album title and see the full list of the album's tracks? The UI is NOT intuitive, as you suggest it is, and it is not convenient. Plus, it's downright misleading - I looked up ""The Bird and the Bee"" and the artist name in the display is cut off at ""the bird and th...""; which makes it impossible to tell right off that several of the tracks are actually by ""The Bird and the Bee Sides,"" a completely different band. (The buy buttons aren't working for The Bird and the Bee, either, and I know their albums are available on Amazon MP3.)As far as finding all the music you looked for and finding whole catalogs rather than just a few tracks, I looked up four or five LA bands (not incredibly obscure ones either; ones that are fairly well known in indie rock circles), and couldn't find anything more than samples or the couple of tracks they had on their profiles already. Is this just MySpace catering to the big labels?I don't know whether MySpace Music just isn't ready for prime time or if it's just another example of a crappy product from MySpace, but it in no way deserves the praise you've lavished on it here.

"          Doing a review for clients, and I can say right now that I'm shocked at this review. MySpace Music is downright awful. As Rogee outlines above, the search experience is ridiculous. Finding music to add to your playlist is a total chore.I wrote an article for Radio & Records back in the nineties about how ""The Thieves Do It Better."" I could easily write one now called ""Rhapsody (and even Zune) Does It Better."" The only thing going for MySpace Music right now is the fact that is free.I wish Yahoo had not been so short-sighted and abandoned music.  They had the interface and the ability to create an ad-supported model that would be actually useful, as opposed to this ""let's pimp as many page views as possible while people are looking for a song"" model.

"          @Jan - I think the most important distinction in this whole conversation is between ""free"" and ""valueless"".  MySpace Music is ""free"" yet it's far from ""valueless"".  In face, MySpace Music has performed an incredible feat of alchemy by taking something that's free and creating $2 billion worth of value (at least paper value) from it.  That's pretty impressive.What shifts here is value exchange.  Rather than exchanging money for music I am now exchanging attention for music.  And what MySpace and others have found is that attention is increasingly valuable in this new world we're moving into.Media companies won't become irrelevant unless they cling to outdated business models.  Some will of course which will open up opportunities for start-ups like Topspin to come in and capture the value they're forgoing.            "
"          Hi Jon - good comment! I still think that getting excited about values based on a 'promise' of ad revenues materialising and other subsequent monetization is especially Lehmanesque and potentially suicidal.

This idea that MySpace or Facebook can achieve that virally from its masses is a fool's gold non-return valve which will in my view end in tears.If I'm wrong then the next logical conclusion is that all media companies will become irrelevant and we'll collectively create our own news, music, films etc. and pass them around our friends within one or two environments......and if that's the case, who's left to pay for this advertising which is supposed to be supporting it all?jan [at] famebook.com            "

"          In some ways, this is revolutionary.  In other ways, I simply don't get it.It's great for new music for sure.  However for older artists the experience sucks.  Which is fine perhaps if this is all about promoting artists who are out touring and whatnot.  But less good if you're thinking about this as a substitute for Rhapsody, etc.Also, the process of looking for music while listening to music is near impossible because almost every page on MySpace auto-plays something.  So if you have the player open in another window and are browsing MySpace looking for new tunes...well, good luck with that.Finally, the lack of a consistent UX on the pages is confusing.I haven't used MySpace all that much so may be missing something.  Having said that, my guess is this is only going to get better over time and, at least for new music, this absolutely confirms the theory of Mike and others that music is rapidly approaching the price of free.

I would recommend against chemical fertilizers because while they'll give you a boost in the short term, they burn off organic matter in your soil over the long term.  So any water-retaining abilities your soil has gets degraded over time, where compost builds organic matter and mulch will help slow evaporation.But shade can also be a culprit...if your plants aren't getting enough sun they'll be stressed and won't do well.compost, compost, mulch, mulch, compost. :)            "
"          I live near you so I experience the same conditions.  I am a lazy gardener (don't amend the soil, rarely water, don't like weeding) but I manage to have a great garden by buying the right plants (well, it also helps to have a friend who works at Gardenworks and another friend with her master gardeners certification).  The biggest problem with our soil is acidity.  So I buy acid loving plants.  Keep that in mind when you go shopping.And when you say partial shade, it's the number of hours and the time of day the sun hits your raised bed that will matter.  A few hours of sun in the morning is not the same as a few hours of sun at noon.If you are thinking coreopsis, I have success with it in my garden.  It needs full sun (at least 8 hours) and I don't water mine now that it's established.  I also have a thyme bush and it has the same conditions.  If you want some free thyme plants, let me know.

But it is a very interesting and satisfying process, if only for a learning experience.

They are cutting welfare in California because of the strain on the system by Illegals and the fact that they are totally bankrupt.   Who goes hungry? Blacks or people that should not be in the US?

I found this information (from : http://blogs.chron.com/immigra... )Illegal immigrants on welfare: fact or fiction?Illegal immigrants swarm into our country and quickly jump on the welfare rolls. They cost hard-working U.S. citizens billions and billions of dollars in taxes because of this subsidy.That's a familiar, easy charge leveled by critics of illegal immigration. But is it fact or fiction?It's actually a myth, according to the Congressional Research Service, the investigative arm of Congress. This point is highlighted as one of the ""top five immigration myths of the campaign season,"" a list put out by the American Immigration Lawyers Association.Here's their look at welfare:    MYTH #3: The nation spends billions of dollars on welfare for undocumented immigrants.    FACTS: To the contrary, undocumented immigrants are not eligible to receive any ""welfare"" benefits and even legal immigrants are severely restricted in the benefits they can receive.    As the Congressional Research Service points out in a 2007 report, undocumented immigrants, who comprise nearly one-third of all immigrants in the country, are not eligible to receive public ""welfare"" benefits -- ever.    Legal permanent residents (LPRs) must pay into the Social Security and Medicare systems for approximately 10 years    before they are eligible to receive benefits when they retire. In most cases, LPRs can not receive SSI, which is available only to U.S. citizens, and are not eligible for means-tested public benefits until 5 years after receiving their green cards.    A 2007 analysis of welfare data by researchers at the Urban Institute reveals that less than 1 percent of households headed by undocumented immigrants receive cash assistance for needy families, compared to 5 percent of households headed by native-born U.S. citizens.    A 2007 analysis of U.S. Census data by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities makes clear that it is the U.S.-born, U.S.-citizen children of undocumented immigrants who are eligible for programs such as Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program    (SCHIP). The analysis found that, between 1995 and 2005, the share of low-income, non- citizen immigrant children (either undocumented or legally present) who received Medicaid or SCHIP dropped from 36 percent to 30 percent.

"          Joanna.   That's exactly what I am thinking right now. Those with an agenda fail to be complete in their presentation of the information and only put forth the side of the facts they want you to see.   Either everyone does not know what it costs for the US government to allow alien invasion (scary that people would be so adamant without really researching with an open mind) or they do know and are purposely misrepresenting the facts.   All the government of the states including California are not lying when they say Illegal Aliens cost them a certain amount of dollars.  The costs of illegal immigration to the taxpayer are numerous, but the largest costs are education of their children, emergency medical care (medicaid is a huge cost and incarceration for those arrested for crimes, food assistance - majority of Illegals get foodstamps and so on.   These are all welfare programs.  Despite being ineligible for ""Welfare""  some illegal aliens also get social assistance the same way they get jobs: with identity documents falsely identifying them as U.S. citizens. In addition, if they have U.S.-born children, they may collect ""Social Assistance""  in the name of those children.   While other parts of the program are just handed out without need to be a US citizen or legal resident.  Free Schooling with language assistance.....Foodstamps and so on. Medicaid use, though significant, is still less than for other households. Only use of food assistance programs is significantly higher than that of the rest of the population. Also, contrary to the perceptions that illegal aliens don't pay payroll taxes, we estimate that more than half of illegals work ""on the books."" On average, illegal households pay more than $4,200 a year in all forms of federal taxes. Unfortunately, they impose costs of $6,950 per household.This was in 2002 prior to all the tax breaks. Now Illegals who pay some taxes get tax credits and nice checks during tax season for evading full payment of taxes. http://redblueamerica.com/trut...            "
"          Damn. If only I had known you knew it all. I would have asked you instead of reading and researching all issues that makeup the problem.  Who needs all the information anyway.    So breaking the law and invading another country aside. ......you really believe that Illegal Aliens don't cost the US taxpayers any money and they contribute more then they take and don't effect employment and wages? In your economic outlook if we opened the borders and unlike any country in the world did not have immigration laws, we would suddenly become a wealthy healthy prosperous nation like we used to be? Uummm I guess like Mexico?   I think you need to get these ideas out to a state like California. They have open borders (sanctuary cities) unfettered access to welfare (you pretty much just need to breath to qualify) yet for some strange reason are bankrupt and plagued with gang violence.     Quick, call them and give them your ideas before we have to pay more taxes for their bailout, Arnold has already asked......

"          Nice try at attemtping to shift the conversation from your original
position. Yes, there is a cost incured by having undocumented immigrants in
the country to society at large. But, that cost can be simply eradicated and
have a positive impact on the economy should there be comprehensive
immigration reform. You stated in your comment that ""illegals"" receive
social services at the cost of tax payers. This is not true, and I'd still
like you to prove me wrong on that fact.

"          Shifting? I stayed precisely on point. Why are you so pompously disingenuous?  You seem like a smart man?  It is all about illegals and social programs. You came back and claimed you knew that illegals do not get welfare/social programs all along when one of your  posters states in her own comments, a post that you replied to,   something that would make anyone honest blink hard before making such a statement.  ""The analysis found that, between 1995 and 2005, the share of low-income, non- citizen immigrant children (either undocumented or legally present) who received Medicaid or SCHIP dropped from 36 percent to 30 percent""So she claims this social program alone was reduced, not that it never existed.  Didn't that give you pause or make you even hesitate with your claim that illegals do not receive social programs or payments at the cost of taxpayers might be easily disproved? Not that anyone even half awake would question that illegals are underwritten by taxpayers.  I have to assume you know this, so then cant understand why you would misrepresent the truth. As you are awaiting proof contrary to again your ridiculous claim that immigrants receiving social services at the cost of taxpayers   ""is is not true, and I'd still like you to prove me wrong on that fact"" ..... well here you go.  The real facts are: Currently just in Arizona to use that state as an example.   Tax revenue collected from Illegal Aliens is 143 M annually this includes property, sales and income taxes. Whilst the cost of supporting illegal aliens is 2.7 BILLION annually. What do you know, they spend 85.5 million on giving welfare to illegal immigrants. Just to clarify because you deny this fact. Welfare and social programs are solely funded by taxes collected from working citizens. Who pay federal income tax and state taxes as well as property and sales taxes.  Illegal Aliens ARE receiving welfare and they don't get this money from La Raza "" The Race"" they get it from US taxpayers. The other social programs provided by tax paying US citizens to illegal Aliens in Arizona are: K-12 education-$1,390.5LEP education-$279.6Medicaid-$259.8   that drop from 36 to 30% isn't having a great impact on AZSCHIP+-$335.0Justice-$339.7Welfare+-$85.5General-$155.4Total Costs -$2,845.6 Billion. For your edification I have included links to this most recent financial review and point by point review of the law and what it actually says and what is legal, just in case , other liberals you are making statements but have not read it  similar to Eric Holder and Janet Nap.. . Look forward to your clarifying that Illegal Aliens Do not receive social services at the cost of taxpayers and where this money comes from. Oh a couple of points to try and offset the expected spin you will give it. Please don't play left whacked out leftist liberal and attack the source in an attempt at deflection. You are welcome to disprove the facts, but I doubt anyone can  challenge the truth. It is written on the books and very clear in AZ financial records.  (conservatives can count) and the savings with reduction of all the above programs when offset against the cost of enforcement would significantly represent a savings for AZ. In fact the economy would pick up when Illegals are removed and employers pay decent wages to Americans who pay their allotted taxes and do not receive social assistance.

country are accidental Americans and by extension should not qualify for
social programs, right? I mean that has to be what you're saying because the
fallacy of your argument is that ""illegal immigrants"" do qualify for social
services. Here's some news: When one doesn't have a social security number,
card, or even a drivers licence (which you have to have the later to attain)
one isn't able to sign up or be accepted for social programs. Try doing that

I was shocked at the level of vocal support this man received!!! The same people who supported the idea of deporting US citizens based on their PARENTS immigration status had NO PROBLEM with the fact that children born in foreign countries who happen to have US citizens as parents or even grandparents are allowed citizenship status in the US EVEN IF THEY HAVE NEVER RESIDED HERE!

If you are dumb enough to still say that Illegal Aliens cannot access social programs and do not receive tax dollars after all of this by throwing in something nonsensical like Oh no...they couldn't do that because its illegal and you need a social security card or try and tug at heart strings by bringing up illegal alien children... well......your words speak for themselves.   But I dont by for a minute buy that you are not aware of the identity theft charges levied against many illegals for working under stolen and forged social security cards. Or the laws on the books that mandate you cannot ask for ID when obtaining a voters registration card (you know more liberal corruption policies) and that when you apply for welfare all you need is a voters registration card or fake SSN.  In Arizona, a disproportionate number of Hispanics (legal residents and/or citizens) have carefully and quietly worked their way into positions of government employment, and therefore it becomes easier to “wink-wink”, when one goes into the Motor Vehicle facilities to apply for a drivers license, at which time you are asked, “would you like to register to vote?” No one asks for a birth certificate, or any other form of ID. It’s so loose, that an alien from outer space could walk in and walk out with the proper certification to drive.Additionally the coyotes make a fortune off of providing transport and FAKE documentation. Also have you heard of    ""  IDs for Illegals: The 'Matricula Consular' Advances Mexico's Immigration Agenda.

"          SO question, are any of those things untrue? I mean you brought it up so lets delve into it are any of those chapter headings false in their claims?It is mighty white of you to be mad when people get to learn exactly how their ancestors entered this country and how they might have been treated. Maybe instead of damning the book you should read it and get an understand through someone else's eyes. America is not perfect, as was admitted in it's founding. Sticking your head in the sand hiding from the truth does not make things better it makes them worse.Make up your mind are they here for the jobs or are they here for welfare? I mean personally I've mopped stalls in my lifetime, cleaned toilets, washed dishes so I know what type of jobs they are getting, they ain the kind people are complaining about losing in droves. People are complaining about losing manufacturing jobs, those are going over seas that would be a big business thing (you know kinda like nike pay taiwanese people 10 a day to make sneakers you sell for 100 bucks a pop), they want their call center jobs back which are going to india where they can pay people 10 bucks a day where you may have had to pay an american that 10 an hour.It isn't illegal immigrants or even poor countries who beg for the manufacturing so that they can get a few grains to feed their families it's business especially large businesses(and some small) who decide that they can up their profit margin by screwing american citizens, over working illegal immigrants who just want a piece of the american dream for their children and grand children.Our economy sucks now because Business sent so many jobs overseas hoping to pad their bottom line instead of paying americans who would then end up turning around to buy their products that they have too much supply, not enough demand and as the credit market has frozen no way for people to find money to buy their products.You're a parrot, you haven't thought this through somebody told you to be angry at poor illegal immigrants and you are. Those immigrants didn't take your job the big boss did.

I try to educate myself on all points and never look at things that only someone with the IQ of a child would rely on to come to conclusions ....you know someones race or quotes from MSM like Mr Tingles.  Do you base all of your beliefs in someones skin color? I hope not... cause then you will stay unaccomplished and not get very far in life. Are you that dumb that you can't understand how citizens from a foreign country teaching hate and sedition on US soil isn't exactly something that will help you in the future?   What other country in the world could you do this?   Then again what other country in the world has become so great that it could for a very long while support so many minimal or non producers giving them time to learn to hate the structure that in essence the world looks to and feeds them.    What will happen to the world when the US cant afford to feed itself let alone help the world ...because of the cancer inside?  We are already there, Have you thought that far or do you think the supermarket will always be full of goodies? What would happen if you went to Mexico and demanded these things, practiced sedition and couldn't immediately show you couldn't support yourself and be a major boon to the economy? Shit, what would happen if you couldn't pay the bribes right off the bat?   Just ask Amnesty international and the Central American immigrants getting raped by Mexican police.  Your the parrot, you start spewing nonsense about the economy that you clearly don't have a clue about, solely parroting talking points you have heard. I will break it down for you easily.   When consumers and entitlements start to outweigh (are more then) people who produce......the economy tanks. It is that simple.   To put it at your level....... If there are ten bushels of apples and ten people. When  5 people produce enough for 10 then everyone eats.    If one of the 5 says, f@ck it. I aint producin, I am oppressed gimme mine and 6 people consume, then four cannot produce enough for everyone and everyone goes hungry.    That is precisely what is happening on the stage of the world economy. More programs, less money...we all lose. How many people could you afford to move into your house before you cant support them all? Think logically. I have to give you credit, the last line did make me laugh though.   I just want to blame somebody because it isn't my fault. That is so damn ironic.   Your takin  what leftists are known for and trying to twist it. No people like me don't blame anyone, they go out and work and make the world and create things. They don't sit at home and cry how the big boss who created the company and gave them their income is a bad man because he wont pay them 100 dollars an hour. They don't blame the world for every one of their bad choices or actions. Like you do.   After all....it is all someone else fault you made those choices, isn't it? Put your money where your mouth is. Assuming you produce and don't just take. Call Uncle Sam and agree to a large tax hike or call some immigrants who arent as well off as you and tell them you will support them.   A real man deals in truth. Someone like you is for Illegal Invasions as long as someone else deals with the problems and pays the bills.            "
"          First off in your example you math is off, badly 10 people, 10 barrels of apples 5 people produce the 10 barrels.That means each producer can create 2 barrels(count them with me one for their own consumption and one for one other person) Now with one producer down, that means instead of having 10 barrels you have 8, which means 8 people can eat and 2 can't.Now let me help you out with another problem you can not have an economics discussion without the goods having a cost.  And if the goods have a cost that means that the one producer he just won't make any money and the other producers will raise the cost of their product up as the DEMAND not outweighs the SUPPLY.Using your simply math now lets say that the payment for the other is a barrel of apples, lets say you're producer decides to fire his employee the other in you 10 people 10 barrels of apples and pick them himself. now you have an extra barrel of apples which will drive the price down because hey all the other folks have their barrel of apples and most likely the guy fired will go work for one of the other producers.And you still haven't answer the question were the statements made in the headings true? Did those things occur, and if so how is teaching someone actual history a problem? Did it make you feel guilty? Did it make you feel like maybe you should be a little more thankful for the things you didn't have to experience? Or did it just make you mad that somebody snitched and told you about this countries bloody history.A real man deals in truth, so I work, pay taxes, and do my best to provide. If they are taking jobs they are working which unfortunately defeats half your argument already, because if they are working how are they just here to collect welfare? As for a large tax hike, are you complaining about subsidizing big oil with their 5.8 billion dollar profits a quarter? The truth is you don't understand economics don't get mad because I properly spotted you as a parrot, it's okay no go do real research and understand what is going on. This country is failing because instead of producing products, paying people to produce those products so that they can in turn turn around and come buy those products, we fire them. Go to another country with depressed wages and then try to ship it back and hope that the folks we fired have enough room left in their credit(debt) line to buy it.That is an unsustainable way to do business. Hell it even breaks the rudimentary rule of the barter system which is I trade you this or how ever many of these it takes of this to equal that and you give me that.Go back to school and learn, you do not understand, never will. Yes you are looking for someone to blame because you came in here with an argument that not only defeated itself but it defeated itself because it couldn't handle the 2-2=0 argument. Simple math, you lost to SIMPLE MATH. ""it is better to be thought a fool, then to open your mouth and remove all doubt""            "
"          Well, it didn't take long for us to find something we completely and totally agree upon. ""It is better to be thought a fool, then to open your mouth and remove all doubt"" There is so much misguided or to be nice.. undeveloped ideas with lack of critical thinking in your post that it would be sadistic for me to reply to most of your thoughts.    To help with a few items though:Given my comments regarding producers and consumers in the US you should have gotten that my math mirrors reality today, but somehow you worked out that you are intellectually superior and you know how to add 5+5 and I do not. Really? I mean really are you that dense that you thought this? OK, good for you. I am glad you can perform rudimentary addition.  Did you read the words or not comprehend the thoughts behind them? Anyway, last try""  Only 47% f the US pays federal income tax. Or another words roughly 5 out of 10 people pay for the majority of this countries costs. Now do you understand producers vs consumers and the assumption that 5 people must produce enough for 10 as 5 are not producing but still consume?If you don't understand how illegals can be receiving social assistance yet still working. What more can I say to you. You need some basic real life lessons before we can have a productive conversation.   But do try this basic critical thinking exercise. Are there any people in the US who work, yet still get social assistance as their income is Reportedly low?  Key words being on ""REPORTED INCOME"" You know, things like SSI supplemental income, food stamps, medicare, , housing assistance. Well I venture to say you probably have heard of this phenomenon in the US, as it is common get it now? Lastly, to me its very ironic that someone who has their entire outlook based on finger pointing and blaming someone in the world for their misfortune rather then looking at their own life choices and actions  is trying to transpose this to someone who does not. By the way. Do some more research on Keynesian Economics. This theory has never worked and never will. Yet some still believe that if you owe money the only way to get out of debt is to borrow and spend, rather then reduce expenses to match your income.  Not very logical at all.              "
"          again with you and math.if we change the 47% to 37% which since you rounded the first one up to 50% to get your 5 you would then have to round the second number up to 40% to get your four.So again defeated by simple math, and if to be a tool you decided I don't wanna round the second time I wanna just add okay that would be 37+37(since you know these people are producing enough to feed themselves and 1 other) then you still wouldn't have 4 people starving or 40% because 37+37 is 74, or 7.4 which is a lot closer to 8 then it is to 6.Go back and re-educate yourself on that rudimentary math. I'm not even having to do any work to defeat you.Oh and here is the precious part, to further prove you point you went on to talk about peoples ""REPORTED INCOME"" which means well I'll be damned they are working and thus the 47% aren't providing for them alone why they are helping to support themselves well I'll be that isn't asking for a hand out at all.A little advice quit copying and pasting somebody else's argument do your own research and come back to me when you comprehend what you are saying. Oh and by the way Supply side economics, you know the one where just the producers produce without any thoughts to the number of consumers who can afford said product that they produce IS KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS. if you create a product you do not make a dime until it is sold so every item on the shelf unsold while it is POTENTIAL income it's debt at the moment. Because if you do not sell it you will either have to buy it back or else you will have to trash it and thus still not recoup any of the funds and be in debt for those products you did not sell.Again you're talking but you don't grasp the concept of simple math or economics, broke out rudimentary though, I mean I'm sure that felt nice.Next um isn't your entire argument that Illegal aliens(party a) are the entire problem in this country right now(the finger you are pointing at them) dude you're being a hypocrite you can't even get half way through an argument without shooting yourself in the foot.And even those this is just rubbing it in, when did I bring up Keynesian economics? On that part we actually said the exact same thing I said that FIRING your american employees who you have to pay 10 dollars an hour(yes I ignored your juvenile attempt to blow it out of proportion by saying 100 bucks an hour, thats what some exacts get paid and are obviously overpaid if our economy is any example of their fine leadership skills) to hire some foriegners whether it be here or in another country so maybe you only have to pay the 10 bucks a day yet pricing it so that it can only be purchased by a person making 10 bucks an hour is stupid. Because you just fired a potential customer with the salary to afford the damn thing.If the person you have making your product, can not afford to buy it, and then you have to ship it back, pay the duties and taxes on it, pay for it to be stocked, or pay for the property on which to sell it but don't have enough demand who can afford it how is that not Keynesian? Again I agree don't purchase something that you either do not have the money for or else can't break it down into bite size enough chunks to be able to afford without taking away from your actual needs:food, clothing, shelter.But firing your potential customers or even the customer of your potential customer is suicide. Again you're lack of economics understanding is mind boggling. You are actually making my argument for me(I know you keep thinking if you just type it out one more time I will believe you, type it a million times you math will still suck)And another thing 47% do not provide for 100% otherwise we would have no homeless in this country. It's probably closer to 96-97% damn good numbers but not the whole, you have to do so much rounding up to even get close to your damn point that the more we delve into it the less of a point you have.  So again 5*2 is 10, 5-1=4 and 4*2=8. If you would like to stop rounding and go to the percentages 47*2 is 94, 47-10(since I'm going to assume you would like that one to also be a percentage point) is 37, 37*2 is 74. 74% fed 26% not.Now if you would like to discuss economics then you have to accept that fact that there has to be a supply and a demand. If the demand is higher then the supply you can charge more for it, if the supply is higher then the demand the price is depressed.  When the price becomes low enough to increase the demand the forces balance out, same thing when the supply reaches the demand when people start buying the product at the higher price or as usually happens more of the product are produced to take advantage of the desire for it.Either way, your ""somebody is getting a free lunch"" theory is shot to hell. If somebody is working and buying products then the producers are getting money from them, not providing for them for free. If the producers pay taxes and then people are given assistance then they go out and buy the producers products once again the producers are getting profit from them.By the way do you know that food stamps can not be used to buy everything, there are limitations on what you can buy with food stamps, I mean who knew right. Yes they do get a set amount of money on their EBT cards on the first and fifteenth but it isn't all cash and they can't just go out balling with it as you seem to have been convinced. But that is an entirely different conversation that I am pretty sure you also aren't prepared for.            "
"          You really are a dumbass arent you?   Of course I rounded it up. Its an example not a rudimentary math exercise.   The example intended to highlight a simple comparison of producers vs consumers.    As for the rest of your post. Jeez...........don't leave home. Stay nice and safe and look for a good job where they will take care of you. A half a brain can be dangerous. Food stamps cannot be used for anything to go balling? What the hell are you talking about.......funny how you know when foodstamps arrive on the first and the fifteenth. Your right. I am not prepared to discuss foodstamps with you or your resentment of the system you obviously partake in.   You do know you can sell them if you are pissed cause you cant use the money for something other then food right?   Good luck with that.

I said it before but can you imagine, California is cutting the state's welfare-to-work program, slashing in-home care for the disabled and elderly and cutting millions from the state's insurance program for low-income children and pregnant women.   Yet they cannot connect the dots and understand why they are broke and want to sanction more illegal immigration and borrow from the feds who are borrowing from the Chinese to make budget. Hope you aren't in California, although budget cuts are coming soon to most major cities.   What else can they do?. When you try and feed the world and bribe everyone, sometimes your own go hungry. That's not good leadership if you ask me and my points have been we need to take care of our own. Put away the crazy agendas and be realistic not hateful and divisive amongst Americans.

You were damn serious.  Worse then clueless and arrogantly adamant about  how little you know.    OK, have it your way.  AS per your comments,  California is broke and has high unemployment because they cant raise real estate taxes (we wont count the jobs illegals in sanctuary cities have taken) even though they already have raised income and state tax and throttled businesses to the point where they have fled the state. Their financial problems have nothing at all to do with handouts and illegal immigrants or being an open welfare state. In fact ignore all of the other states that have high entitlements and have been run by liberals with ludicrous policies that are coincidentally broke as well.  Damn...what a coincidence.   Maybe they need to raise real estate taxes in these failing democrat liberal led cities as well. That will fix it. And you are right, no it isnt paying for programs for illegals and expanded entitlements that have cause more spending and debt in California at all. There is no relation. No, its the republicans who have failed to face the economic crisis by looking to STOP spending that is causing them to be in more debt. Yup, thats it.   Raise taxes, keep spending then the debt will vanish.   HotDamn, can I have your credit card. I want to help with your debt, no really!!    Your wife must love you if your answer to saving money is to just give her more money even though you make the same amount. Woo hoo, that is just brilliant!!!So your plan would be, Don't cut spending. Bring in more illegals, provide more welfare, give out more handouts. Raise taxes more to pay for it and then wonder why businesses have fled the state and tax revenue evaporates.   Even Hollywood is dieing with filmmakers going to Canada to shoot movies because of taxes levied to support the entitlement state. I know, you knew that right? !!Anyway, I guess you still believe Illegals dont collect taxpayer funded social programs and the states are lying and that Illegals cant possibly collect because there is no way they can get fake documentation, the illegal problem is all a republican plot to supress votes. There is plenty of money to pay for everyone but republicans are racist and just don't want to share.     I wont argue with that. Not that I cant, I just wont, whats the point.            "

You do realize they passed prop 13 to stop people from fleeing the state right? People were leaving then as they are now because of taxes especially the yearly real estate bill that whalloped homeowners. When they passed prop 13 in 1978, they compensated with local taxes added onto federal and state taxes adding high taxes on businesses.  Look at the end of the day you can only work so much. What needs to stop is the spending.   The answer to debt is not to spend more and tax more. The answer is to reduce corruption and waste and stop spending.  They are looking into amending prop 13 to get more revenue. When that happens do you think people will flock to California to open businesses, buy houses to support illegal immigration, save the little goldfish but starve the farmer programs? Or do you think people will leave at an even quicker rate and then California will be in even deeper shit?   If you take the right amount from everyone then everyone gives without problem. You push it too far and you lose it all.            "
"          I was on a cooking message board discussing this issue when the bill was first passed. (Mostly white) women on there were claiming that illegal immigrants were ""stealing jobs"" from American citizens, causing crime, and siphoning taxpayer money by using American resources. What the refused to see was that in many areas, immigrants perform jobs that are extremely low paying and have terrible working conditions. A lot of the jobs immigrants hold are those which Americans turn their noses up at, as evidenced by the fact that there are ""guest worker"" programs in place in this country to import foreign workers for temporary agricultural work. I guess these farm workers should just accept poor working conditions and low pay and be happy they are allowed to work in the US without any of the rights of citizens? Do people honestly believe that it is OK for bring people in to work, then kick them out of the country as soon as they are no longer needed to perform our grunt work? People also claim that illegal immigrants are causing crime, but the fact is that areas with high numbers of immigrants actually have lower crime rates than areas with less immigrants.  People take a few isolated cases and claim it is a ""crime wave"". As for using taxpayer money and resources, the majority of illegal immigrants actually DO pay taxes and contribute to the economy.It really boils down to this: People want someone to blame for all of their woes. Today it is undocumented immigrants. Tomorrow it will be someone else, and often people accept that reality as long as they are not the ones who are being oppressed. Among the first anti-immigrations laws in this country were ""Black Codes"" passed in the mid to late 1800s prohibited Black immigration from the Southern to northern states. Indiana and Illinois both passed laws prohibiting free Blacks from settling in their states. When I compared current anti immigration legislation to these statutes, the group of women on the message board claimed that there were NO PARALLELS! Yet the reasons given for passing these ""Black Codes"" were EXACTLY  the same reasons they were enumerating for why they were against illegal immigration!Sorry, I think this comment is kind of rambling... but the whole issue of immigration law in Arizona was the reason I finally decided to start a blog, and my first few posts were about it!

I like unemployment and high taxes please let more Aliens Invade the US so I don't have  a chance?I don't think they would take the job if the employer wanted to pay them 6 $ an hour off the books so they both could avoid taxes, but what do you think they woudl say? No that work is beneath me? This isnt about race, skin color. It is about following the laws of the United States of America. This is a country of laws promoting equality. If you disregard those laws and penalize the citizens? Who is the next special group that will be allowed to be free from penalty of breaking the law?   Next thing you know we will be Mexico.   The US only has so many resources. Why do you want to take those resources and dwindle them even more by allowing invasion of our country. Why can't Immigrants follow the law and apply?

"          Well, perhaps that's the problem in a nutshell. Your not very bright. Despite my giving you specific examples of jobs illegals are taking, you list mopping floors at wal-mart.   Then you advocate that there are things that Americans are to uppity to do to earn a living, yet it is ok for someone to sit at home and collect checks while not being producers. The question is how old are you? Do you still believe mommy and daddy are responsible for everything and all the choices you made in life are the responsibility of someone else and that someone will magically pay the bills while you sit on the couch because life is unfair? So you don't have to do anything that is ""beneath"" you, despite your probably only having earned skills that qualify for menial jobs? (I don't know this but am basing it on your intellect) I have mopped floors, picked fruit, mixed cement by hand, picked up horse shit and hay, cleaned toilets  on my way to paying for my own college and a lot more menial jobs, supporting myself then becoming VP of a large international corporation, followed by owning my own succesful business. Now what do you do to earn a living and produce?  Cry about other peoples hard work and achievements? You see in your world its better to be broke and oppressed and point the finger then do a job beneath you , even if you have no skills. In my world I believe that no one owes me anything and anything I achieve will be gained through my hard work, initiative and intelligence. No 'job is beneath a man as opposed to taking someone else's handouts or taking something that he has not earned, have you no self respect?   Well that would explain a lot, no self respect makes you impossible to respect the hard work of others, after all it is beneath you, but being a leech is not. What f@cked rationale to explain away failure and lack of effort.      I don't agree with your disgusting view of Americans, so I am not using my head.  No you are the despicable element of this country.  Most Americans will do whatever is necessary to support themselves and despite having multiple degrees are working at menial jobs as needed.   Only you are one of the ones that apparently think the world owes you something so if it is  ""beneath you"" sit at home and collect a check.    Well don't come to me for more handouts when you sit at home because that job is Beneath you.   And don't come crying to me when it all crashes down and those who did not invest time and effort in improving themselve and who think working at menial jobs go hungry.

"          In my world yah yah, in your world it's better to bitch at the victims then acknowledge the problem and fix it.By the way paying for a college education(though you seem to have little evidence of having one, I mean hell you're arguments aren't you don't even seem to be able to stay with the conversation you are responding to but that is neither here nor there) and jumping DIRECTLY to a VP at some INTERNATIONAL COMPANY is some feat. Here's the problem you were either the most deaf dumb and blind guy working you're way up the ladder or else you just tried to float me a load of bullshit to give weight to your STILL weak and unrealistic argument. Simply put Mr. Former VP and current SUCCESSFUL business owner if your business tanked today, and you needed a job would you go back to shoveling horse shit(actually from your arguments specious nature here I would venture that you never stopped), how about mopping floors? Washing dishes maybe?If the answer is no then guess what you just admitted that some things were beneath you. And that is not always a bad thing if it drives you to do something better or work harder for a more appealing opportunity. Now if all you do is sit on your ass I agree you're a lump and a waste of space.I mean I could falsify a resume too, hell I wouldn't stop at being the VP though shit why not be the president, and then I would run a WELL KNOWN successful business. But nice try, if you were a VP you were overpaid, it's your type of attitude and lack of understanding that has us in this financial mess, you cut off your nose to spite your face and then complain that the food tastes funny.Because for you to have started as someone shoveling shit, mopping, washing dishes and doing all kinds of other menial labor and not notice the people staring down their noses at you because they felt they were better then you, you are a bigger fool then I earlier thought. We have become a country of the entitled and the EXPECT to be privileged, and you prove it. You run your mouth with absolutely no understanding of the subject matter and then when you attempt to swoop in with grandiose style to say ""well I worked my way up from the bottom with no help from anyone"" you either prove that you got undeserved breaks or else that you are currently shoveling horse shit.Don't let the good looks fool ya, I've been quite a few places, dealt with many different people and have a nice little bit of knowledge tucked under that bald pate of mine. I could care less what your title is, I care about the character of your person and the depth of your understanding. You seem to have little of both.And if you are wondering, yes I have a job that is beneath me FLIPPING BURGERS. That is my rock bottom, that is what gets me up on mornings when I don't have a job and has me ironing my slacks, making sure I am presentable and putting my best foot forwards. I refuse to flip burgers as an occupation I will bust my ass to find a job doing anything else to not have to do that. And I have done a lot of things myself: washed dishes, bussed tables, mopped floors, played handy man, stocked shelves, etc , etc.  Taught myself a lot of things too so that I could better provide for my family and make the most of my american opportunities. So me hearing an obvious tall tale about what somebody has done yet they don't have the simple understanding on how to do a math problem or how to make sure that their percentages are within the range of their argument.If you were VP of anything is was the shit shovelers association of america.

But don't forget that the main objective was that you insisted illegals are performing jobs no one else will because it is beneath those that are unemployed. I totally disagree. Unemployment is very high ,   Illegals drive down wages and take jobs,  they take jobs that any American citizen in the country legally should have a first crack at and the job will pay a decent competitive wage (when someone illegal isn't in the country to do it for next to nothing) because they are subsidized by taxpayer programs.  It is that simple. Yes before you respond with a talking point, the employers need to be held 100% responsible and arrested if you ask me.    As far as what you do for a living and have done. I honestly respect that.  Good for you. Any man who takes care of his own, no matter how hard and sometimes painful, has earned and  deserves complete respect. It wont always be that way, look for ways to get the better job even if it means night school or training. I do it all the time and since you asked earlier, I could give a shit what anyone thinks of me if I am working and supporting myself.   When I travel to one of my locations, I help unload trucks or do whatever is needed. My people respect me, they don't look down on me and if they did, that would say a lot about them and they would be people I do not respect.   Sincerely, Good luck.

Everything has a value, some jobs are worth more then others it's just the way the world works. So is people cutting corners and trying to shave money off the cost to create their product to put more profit in their pocket.Which I don't have a problem with if this shaving is done by streamlining your business, ending wasteful expenditures, upgrading equipment and procedures and cross training your workforce. I do have a problem with it if you fire your long term employees to hire new cheaper ones, working them longer hours(with the threat of turning them in if they complain), paying them less then minimum wage, not providing benefits or adequate leave, and then on top of that take government subsidies.Your way will not fix our current economic crisis. To fix it we must bring the jobs lost back. Do me a favor, ask around with you're friends and similarly leveled peers, not the guys on the floor the other guys in offices and ask them what they would do if the roof caved. How many suicides of formerly rich folks have we had since this current financial crisis started?I know you don't want to think people can act that way, it is repugnant I agree. But unfortunately that is how some people act and it shines a sickly light on all of us. And by the way I have asked people, before this crisis happened(and the one before it with the housing bubble)while the majority had either a plan of action or a can do attitude, there were a lot of folks who basically said they wouldn't pretty much give up hope. That they couldn't make it because they had to make X amount of dollars and they didn't see where or how.I'm crazy like that, I don't mind striking up a philosophical conversation with a complete stranger, I like to see how PEOPLE think, not some canned statistic that they probably have been cherry picking both the focus and the control group just to get their desired result.While you might be a decent guy I'm afraid you haven't looked at this issue past the talking points, and you obviously haven't spent a lot of time talking to your fellow americans. It might be time to stop talking to people who you know think like you and start talking to folks who's affiliations you aren't sure of and go past the whole oh well he must be a moron because he doesn't think like me impulse. You rob yourself of a lot of insight that way.And again, if you notice the only part of your argument I disagreed with was the what MATH, I even redid the problem for you. Showed where your stats if used correctly did paint a picture, just not the one you were claiming. You have yet to actually sit down, read what I said and admit yup I was wrong, hmm nope not perfect, nor a desirable scenario but yes 20-26% not 40% would POSSIBLY be up shits creek if another 10% of the workforce dropped off the map.That is the first step in actually coming to an understanding. Not trying to blindly push forward a broken premise but saying okay yup my error, okay fine if this is our new starting point then what.

Perhaps if you re-read the book, you will grow to love the concept.Having read the book, I don't think Ferriss makes a point to get rich quick and retire early. I think the his point is to show that it's possible to blend work with pleasure and enjoy a life of semi-retirement.In other words, Why spend your time working in a company for 50 years -- waiting out the entire time so you can finally retire and start living the dream life -- when it's possible with today's technology to run a business while visiting the very places you dream of? Furthermore, one of Ferriss's stepping stones to living such a life is using the tools available to us to ensure that the time we spend working is put toward something meaningful.  If you're a photographer, and it's your mission to be creative and photograph things, why waste time answering phone calls, setting up appointments, and tracking down receivables, when those activities have nothing to do with photography and probably aren't what you're best at?  Doesn't it make more sense to hire someone to do those things, especially when that person could probably do them more efficiently than you could? The flip-side is that, when properly connected, an office manager could also be using technology to allow him or her to handle multiple office tasks, not from an office but from anywhere in the world.Those are the points of the book, and I think you missed them.

Perhaps Tim can do things that other people simply can not do. Much in the same way that Shaq can write a “how to” on basketball.(2) Tim GAMES THE SYSTEM. That’s his personality. He’s all about shortcuts. At the end of the day, do you want to look at your life and say - wow, I shortcut my way through life. Don’t believe me? He brags about winning a very well-respected martial arts tournament by manipulating his body weight and taking advantage of a loophole in the system that allows him to toss guys out of the ring. So you’ve got guys who dedicated their lives to this sport - and tim comes in  - analyzes a weakness. A business lesson? Yes. A good way to live your life? Questionable.(3) Tim values adventure. He’s an adventure seeker. And that’s cool. But not everyone is, some people like comfort, safety and security. Not because they are oppressed by the man, but because they like to sit by the fireplace with their wife and know that money will be coming in twice a month. Is this tim’s personal philosophy? no. But is it right for him to group everyone who thinks this way as a victim? no. Does he? Well, yea, sorta…(4) Tim’s big message is this. LIFE IS A RACE. Screw the process - just get results following my “life hacks”. Work sucks. Don’t grow up. Don’t get a job. Don’t save - spend - because you might die. If you want a sports car get one - don’t worry about that because (insert smartly crafted, hard to refute arguement #94).  Think you really want to work? Think again. Look at me. I dance tango, lift weights, and travel using an american express. I don’t answer emails because im too busy figuring out how to beat martial arts masters, don’t bother me - i’m too busy figuring out how to launch my book.(5) Oh an finally, i hate to say it but his fortune is in a bunch of pills that don’t work.  I used to wrestle back in high school, i watched kids as they popped his pills and then wondered where their money (and results) went.

I'd just like to do it more ethically than the martial arts example!What resonated with me were a few things:1. you don't HAVE to work 9-7pm every day in your business only to ask on your deathbed wondering ""where did my life go?'2. as a small business operator I often find myself being 'busy' and not productive. I am retraiing myself to enjoy the company of others rather than slaving away at tedious tasks others are better qualified to do eg my business accounting3. we don't all have to be millionaires: we just need to work out what money we need and generate enough income to facilitate that. A much better perspective in my view. Although we still need to put money away for an assumed old age.If we look back at history, our ancestors didn't slavishly grind away in a demarcated life ... they worked a little, ate a little, worked a little, played a little.

1. Mind Quick sounds like a load of crap and why should I be listening to someone who would sell crap.
2. I love his life sculping concept and when I start my process, I'm going to make my company mean something positive to the world.            "
"          Right on the money. I would also add the fact that the book lacks a lot of structure and needs some serious editing. There is a lot of repetition, useless anecdotes which really don't amount to much.You focused on the main flaw which is this dissociation between work and life, and the idea that work is unpleasant and should be avoided or sent to a VA.            "
"          good points. thanks. love the spirit of your idea.            "
"          Of course some of the thoughts you raise ring true.  I agree wholeheartedly people shouldn't all be leaving school / college with some entrenched depressing notion that work is shxte, best accept then, and then do as little as possible of it.  We should be looking for what we can be passionate about, and hopefully finding it.But for starters, I don't think (hope) Ferris' book is made for school leavers.  For those who have already been working, perhaps for a long time, and perhaps in things which do little to get our enthusiasm firing....At least some of his book may be well more applicable in this case.  Sure, maybe that's the individual's mistake - that they got themselves ""trapped"" on some path. But we don't necessarily have perfect knowledge when we leave school.  We don't necessarily have great role models to encourage us in what's possible.  And without a little magic, it's easy to find yourself well into the requirement to feed and house yourself well before you have a stable idea of what you're passionate about.  Besides, quite simply, at this point, it's already done.  As great as the idea of a career change, and it is certainly an option, nonetheless to go chasing what gets you going more can be tricky.  The more responsibilities one has (family, etc), the trickier it can be.And what of those of us whose real passions don't happen to involve things that require time much more than they provide any real personal financial security?  Deliberately choosing that is a big call.            "

"          Michael,

Nice website you have here... And while I do agree with you that we've all been brought up on the idea that work = doing something you don't like but is necessary anyway to bring home the bacon/bread/rice (depending on which part of the world you're from--I'm from Asia), unfortunately, the idea that work can be self-actualizing is simply a dream that most of the world cannot afford. Most of the world, for better or worse, remains largely industrial. Huge factories, like those you find in China, hire workers by the thousands to pump out your favourite clothes, gadgets, or what have you so that people in the first world might enjoy material comforts the likes of which are beyond the reach of 80% of the world's population. (Ok, no statistics, I'm just generalizing). So the bottom line is, for most of the world's population, people do not work for self-actualization. They work to keep themselves alive. Granted, Tim is probably writing for an American audience (or at least those who can even afford to or bother to pick up his book), one that is probably not in the kind of dire economic circumstances that I talk about.            "

"          Excellent perspective.  I was on the fence about the 4 hour work week philosophy. Your post and insight happened at the perfect time.  Thanks            "
"          I recently read the 4 hour work week, and at first read was really inspired.  I really liked the concepts behind the book - at first.  More than anything, I was drawn to the idea of simplicity.  Why over complicate things I asked myself.  Keep it simple, and keep it moving forward.  I have even implemented a few strategies.  But, as time went on, I started questioning the moral issues of the book.  Something just didn't feel right with some of the strategies.   Then I hit your post, and it was like a camera coming into focus.  Your perspective on the 4 hour work week helped clarify the big picture for me.  I think there are some take away thoughts and concepts from the book that I will keep and even implement, but the reality is I am proud of what I do for a living, and don't want to hack my way through it. I put my stamp of quality on all things I do.  I believe you can have balance and not have to be a career hack at the same time.  Imagine the whole Nation hacking and taking short cuts through life.  What kind of accomplishments would we achieve as a whole?            "

"          I read the 4-Hour Work Week shortly after it came out.  And it changed my life.  How?It made me finally realize that I can choose my own lifestyle.  I don’t have to follow pre-conceived notions that society places on us, especially in terms of work, and especially here in the US.That’s what is so powerful about the idea of the 4-Hour Work Week:  That you don’t need to follow the rules.  You can make your own rules.  Live in your own system.  Set your own standards.Before reading the book, I was often stressed out.  Worried about whether I was working hard enough.  Pushing myself in unreasonable ways to work even harder.  But, when I read the book, I realized, hey I can transform my business so that it runs itself…so that it doesn’t require me….so that I can work WHEN I want, how much I want. And…most importantly…I can WORK on the kind of stuff I enjoy the most.I like playing.  These days I think of my business as a ‘toy’ I get to play with.  I get to push buttons and pull levers, and see results. (And I get to receive gratifying human feedback as a bonus!)I will admit:  After automating my business, I became depressed.  I stopped doing much of anything. And let me tell you, too much free time is HARD on the soul.  It wears you down.  Day in and day out of NOT working is as depressing as being unemployed.But then I realized…hey, this is all part of the process of designing the life I want. Of CHOOSING the life I want.  Experimenting with it.  Growing, expanding, failing, succeeding.And that certainly isn’t easy.  No matter how much you work.  (And that’s why life is wonderful.) But it’s led to great things for me. And I am ever grateful to Tim Ferriss for the ideas he presented in the 4 Hour Work Week.            "

What do all of these devices have in common? An audio jack.Make sense yet?Also, the case solution means that no only can you only use it on iPhone (a shame, since Square's iPad app is absolutely amazing, with inventory support and everything), but you can only use it on iPhones that are 3G/S-shaped. Bummer. You really want to buy a new case reader every 2 years when you upgrade your phone? Or be locked in to having to use iOS or a mobile device in general?Square will win this because it's free, it's way prettier (have you seen the app(s)? Check 'em out. They're well-designed), and it'll work on everything.	        	        	    	"
"	    	        Square is more compatible but then it means you can record the credit card number as an audio file and replay it over and over. The Mophie solution sends the card number encrypted to the iphone. If done right, it should be safer and you should be prevented from replaying the encypted transaction over and over. As a customer, I would prefer using Mophie over Square but how do we know that Mophie did it right and is safe to use for the customer?How could the credit card companie let Square do it??? seems unsecure to me!

I think at least for AT&T customers with iPhones, the Nexus phone poses a threat to them and adjusting their pricing plan is a good faith effort. As much as I love my iPhone, I can tell you that if AT&T doesn't get more competitive by the time Google gets all the bugs worked out, I will be jumping ship as I am done paying these ridiculous prices.

"          Nothing fishy. The Even More Plus plan is contract-free, with lower monthly bills but no subsidized phone. After about 16 months you get ahead of the game and save more money than getting a phone and a more expensive 2-year contract.            "

"          Ah, this is where Apple genius comes in. If you were to have background apps, you could receive sms/im/twitter/facebook and any other notification in real time as it is sent.However since Apple agreed not to provide this ability, they can charge extra for the victims they send to AT&T because the said victims would need to constantly open those apps, or to pay for every sms that they receive. In the end everyone surrenders and just pays. Its a form of a luxury tax, that Apple customers are familiar with.            "
"          Perhaps for the convenience factor? Because it's still more reliable? To get native integration?If people want to text you one one of those apps, they need to send them to a new email address.  If you only text with a small group, then that may work out great.  Also, I don't know about you, but my phone often misses push notifications.If you're more like me and text with lots of people, sometimes infrequently, the convenience and reliability of ""real"" texting is necessary.

They know that you inevitably will use less voice and more data.  They could give unlimited to everybody, we wont call more.  Verizon and AT&T crunched the numbers, this price drop will translate in more revenue for them.            "
"          Oh c'mon now -- you posted that just to troll.Even if your needs only require talking for 60 mins/month (and mine aren't much more), surely you know plenty of people who talk much more than that.Even if people are talking less as of late, unlimited plans cater to those who still talk a lot.  People like you and me are content with the minute-limited cheaper plans.These moves seem more aimed at keeping heavy users on their networks and not switching to more price-conscious options on T-Mobile and Sprint (whose $99/month unlimited everything is awfully tempting).            "
"          No I agree with Loic- With 900 minutes I maybe use only 100 due to unlimited nights/weekends, mobile-mobile, unlimited to your A-List (for out of network), plus roll-over. My rollover balance has been 7-8K, for past three years. While back, I was going to drop down to the smallest package, but then I would lose the unlimited features that were preserving my anytime minutes, thus I wouldn't save money cause I end up needing those minutes.It's all shell game. The 900 minute plan ($60) is to me, unlimited. I hear the same from friends.However, this will appeal to a small number of people, likely those who don't work around a land line during the day when minutes burned.            "
"          This is actually pretty amazing... all these cuts of late:  Tmob, Verizon, AT&T... and frankly, these price battles will only continue while the networks get better and the phones, smarter.Makes me wonder if the carriers perhaps already know of an upcoming ""unlocked CDMA+GSM"" iphone.. BBerry.. more android devices.The carriers are going to try to milk all these voice+text contracts... locking people in now... before they realize that (at least, very soon) the cheaper data plans are all they need.

You pay $119.99 for a smart phone however you use a superior network with proven faster speeds.  Sprint has 1/5 the towers that AT&T has...they rely on Verizon as a roaming partner which hurts their voice and data coverage quite a bit.  And 4g...what a joke...its is too few areas to even talk about!If I were you I would leave Sprint and go to a company that doesn't lose 900,000 net subscribers in a quarter....Sprint is a dying breed...

"          Voice + data isn't the same as voice + text. iPhone customers pay $30/month for data, so they do get the same price as feature phone users at $99.99 for voice + data.

"          Sam, your pupil is probably just finding learning a language tough. One of the best linguists I have worked with as a colleague is totally red/green colour blind. I only found this out when I presented him with a computer screen with red text on a green background (not one of my designs!). ""What do I have to do?"" he asked, ""The screen is blank.""

My daughter is a professional graphic designer. After she graduated from college and had learned all about colours and their positive and negative affects, especially in advertising material, she began to shoot holes in my screen designs. A lot has been written about the psychology of colours, e.g.

"          Interestingly Graham, this year I have a Year 11 pupil who has recently been diagnosed as colour blind. He has always struggled with learning Spanish and it dawned on me that maybe the colours I was using were not creating the grammatical awareness for him that the other pupils had picked up on.

I contacted his Head of Year with this query, but was told that his main issue was a variety of colour combinations which (thankfully) I hadn't used - I am still trying to figure out what he finds difficult in order to help him pass his GCSE!            "
"          Good post. Keep it simple - nice! Just a quick comment on colours:

We touch on this topic in Section 3 of Module 3.2 at the ICT4LT site under the heading General program design principles. The principles are based to a large extent on what we learned designing the TELL Consortium programs in the 1990s. The main rules re colour are in Section 3.5. We discovered early on in our work that red/green colour blindness is common, affecting around 8% of European males, i.e. both colours look the same if you have this type of colour blindness. Above all, one should avoid using colour opposites in combination: red/green, blue/orange, yellow/violet.

I was once taken to task by a BBC producer who took one look at my early computer programs and told me that I was over-using colour and using ""illegal"" colour combinations. After that, like Samantha, I kept it simple!

Have a look at Module 3.2:

Graham            "
"          How very true Graham. I do indeed teach two boys this year who are colour blind and I always need to be mindful of which colours I can and can't use. 

Nevertheless, the principles Samantha lays out are very sound and often it's simple things like using colours imaginatevely in a word document or a Powerpoint that make a grammar explanation memorable.            "

"          There's a package for R to regularize a time series with irregular time steps called pastecs.  I used the regarea method in that package to produce time series for deltaD and ln(CO2(t)/CO2(to)) from the Law Dome ice core data for the period from 9,000 BP to 21,700 BP.  the ADF test strongly rejected the hypothesis that the series weren't stationary, p values of 0.9 and 0.46.  So can temperature and CO2 forcing change integration order over time?  I suspect not.

There is a problem, of course.  The lag between deltaD and CO2 means that CO2 is a function of deltaD.  That doesn't mean that CO2 can't amplify the change in deltaD, though.            "

Also, what Thomas Anderson wrote is true :\

""Why we needed to have that little intro at the beginning that gave away that they got to the island safe and sound is beyond me.""

The episode would've been so much better if they didn't do that. I mean, you watch the entire episode with full knowledge that they do make it back. On the other hand, if we didn't know, we'll be wondering during the whole episode:

Who is going to make it?
Will it work?
Will anyone die?
...etc
